However, the site’s reputation for scoring solid exclusives early on – that often wind up coming true – suggests that Sinise could be joining the all-star pic.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>General Wade Eiling first appeared in DC’s The Atom comic series as the villain to its titular hero before being later recruited into the Suicide Squad after his regenerative powers proved to be rather advantageous to their mission. Most recently the character appeared on CW’s show, The Flash, played by Clancy Brown.</p><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=830 data-injectable=false>Two years back Sinise, finished up a lengthy stint on CSI:NY, after which he’s returned to the big screen for&nbsp;a few bit parts. Interestingly enough, one of those recent credits is as a narrator in Captain America: The Winter Soldier – which originated from DC’s rival studio, Marvel. Will he jump ship to join <strong>Suicide Squad</strong>? We’ll keep you posted if the rumor turns into reality. Until then, though, let us know what you think of Sinise joining the pic in the comments below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonpqqqWLAqrrIrJxmqqWivLOxw2ahqKGenruoedKuoJyhlJp6tL3Umptmn5WjsrOty2acoqSZo7Rw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erin-moriarty-plastic-surgery-face-body-changes-rumor.html><span>←</span><span>Erin Moriarty Was Slammed With Plastic Surgery Criticisms After Fans Noticed Huge Changes To Her Fac</span></a>
