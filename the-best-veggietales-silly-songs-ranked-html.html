Vischer initially conceived an animated chocolate bar as the main character, but after his wife suggested that parents might see it as promoting unhealthy eating habits, he switched to fruits and vegetables. And thus, VeggieTales was born, a show populated by Bob the Tomato, Larry the Cucumber, and a whole motley crew of talking asparagus, gourds, peas, and zucchini.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52f1ou00193g6fygjnd2ke@published data-word-count=138>Most episodes of the direct-to-video series retold Bible stories like the Battle of Jericho or David and Goliath or focused on teaching vaguely Christian principles such as loving your neighbor and telling the truth. But VeggieTales eventually transcended its churchy roots, spawning a Saturday-morning cartoon and two theatrically released movies. Even if you weren’t raised as a religious Christian, if you grew up in the 1990s or 2000s, you’ve probably seen at least one VeggieTales video. And if you were one of those kids for whom the Christian messaging sailed straight over your head, your memories are most likely tied not to parables via the produce aisle but to “Silly Songs With Larry” — a funny little segment inserted into the middle of each episode, in which Larry the Cucumber comes out and sings, well, a silly song.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52f2yg001a3g6f4kufppq9@published data-word-count=107>“Silly Songs” was a runaway success, with several compilation videos such as A Very Silly Sing-Along!, The End of Silliness?, and The Ultimate Silly Song Countdown, in which thousands of fans voted for their favorite Silly Songs. Years have passed since the first Silly Song graced our VHS players, but many of the songs still hold up, while others … less so. With two original series on Netflix, a rebooted VeggieTales show currently airing, and a third movie in development, we’re taking the opportunity to rank the good, the bad, and the very, very silly songs, with input and behind-the-scenes stories from Larry the Cucumber himself, Nawrocki.</p><span class=divider-border></span><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki52n0ji004f3g6fp8v1xy1m@published>42. ‘The Agitated Song’ (2020)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52f5b4001c3g6f44kf4nko@published data-word-count=66>Larry comes onstage, sings four lines (“I’m very, very upset / And I’m not having fun / So if you will excuse me / My little song is done”), and exits stage left, presumably too agitated to continue. It’s a shame, as a full version could have real potential to be the defining anthem of this Current Moment, but four bars do not a song make.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij41chm000r3g6bx1bscq1n@published data-word-count=27><strong>Mike</strong> <strong>Nawrocki:</strong> I don’t even recall that one! It probably got buried in one of those recording sessions. That’s funny. I’ll have to look that one up.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki52pee3004q3g6fhs07uchq@published>41. ‘My Golden Egg’ (2015)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52f907001e3g6f6cymwtxd@published data-word-count=86>In 2014, Netflix commissioned a new VeggieTales series that included an updated character design. “My Golden Egg” is the only Silly Song that utilizes the new design, and for good reason —&nbsp;it’s an insult to vegetables everywhere. The song is decent, I suppose, though I confess I didn’t listen to it carefully, as I was too busy pointing at the cucumber on my screen and shouting “Impostor!” I have no idea who performed this song, but it certainly wasn’t the Larry we all know and love.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij42618000x3g6bh6ysbyvd@published data-word-count=27><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> We did some new episodes for a new streaming service called Yippee, where we’ve gone back to the original VeggieTales animation style, which I also prefer.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki52tdth005d3g6fre0juzqm@published>40. ‘Donuts for Benny’ (2009)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52fcsa001g3g6f5axx9m4s@published data-word-count=125>As a Christian franchise, VeggieTales is predictably very into Christmas; four out of the 42 Silly Songs are Christmas themed. None of them rank particularly high on this list, but “Donuts for Benny” is by far the weakest. Helmed by Mr. Lunt (a decorative gourd whose wispy mustache and missing eyes are pretty unsettling), the song is about a mangy mutt named Benny begging for scraps outside a doughnut shop. When Benny gets a couple deep-fried treats in him, however, he turns into a whirling dervish that sweeps up Mr. Lunt in an energetic jig. The abrupt tonal shift from heartfelt ballad to jaunty ditty is quite jarring, and both Benny and Mr. Lunt are kinda creepy, so it’s gonna be a no from me!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij4304p00133g6b0puh9q04@published data-word-count=72><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> I was visiting my in-laws, my wife’s sister, and she worked at a high school up in the Chicago area. I was going through the school, and they had a poster up that said “Donuts for Benny.” It was some sort of fundraiser for the school — they had a dog mascot — and I just thought that was really funny, so I took that phrase and created this little story.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki52uvbk005v3g6fuunioiu3@published>39. ‘Best Friends Forever’ (2012)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52fdp0001i3g6ff6reurr2@published data-word-count=76>Who the hell are these girls? Where the hell is Larry? “Best Friends Forever” consists of Laura Carrot and Papaya Poppyseed declaring their undying devotion to each other via chatspeak (“You’re my BFFLNMW” — a.k.a. Best Friend for Life No Matter What). “Best Friends Forever” seems like VeggieTales’ effort to appeal to a new generation of tech-savvy, phone-obsessed youngsters, but, sadly, like all adult attempts to pander to children, the result is woefully out of touch.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij44fyl00193g6b8s8ornyb@published data-word-count=58><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> My daughter was in middle school and was texting her friends constantly, so I thought it would be fun to do a song based on all the texting acronyms — LOL and BFF and all that. It was a challenge for me to take all these acronyms and make them into a song and make them rhyme.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki52xbed006h3g6fnic29u9r@published>38. ‘Pants’ (2010)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52ffcp001k3g6f8nzo3iym@published data-word-count=86>You know that saying “Necessity is the mother of invention”? If that were true, theoretically pants shouldn’t even exist in the VeggieTales universe, because vegetables don’t have legs and therefore don’t need pants. “Pants” tries to get around this glaringly obvious fallacy by forcing Jerry and Jimmy Gourd to balance on stilts in order to advertise the pants Larry is selling. It’s unclear which vegetables would buy themselves such a thoroughly useless garment — the most plausible possibility I can think of is a <a href=#>mutated carrot</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij459o8001f3g6b4ozi2d5h@published data-word-count=39><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> I just love that visual of Jerry and Jimmy on their stilts. And at the very end, the pants get taken off of the gourds, and Jimmy comments on Jerry’s skinny legs, which I thought was really funny.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki531bfr006z3g6f4hduzpbe@published>37. ‘Supper Hero’ (2012)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52fg25001m3g6fe8libjhm@published data-word-count=93>This is the only song to feature “Larryboy,” Larry’s crime-fighting alter ego who makes sporadic appearances throughout the franchise. In keeping with the superhero theme, “Supper Hero” features Jimmy Gourd in the titular role. Jimmy comes to the rescue when Larryboy is served an unappetizing plate of Brussels sprouts and sauerkraut. Unfortunately, our Supper Hero proves to be fairly indiscriminate when deciding which dinners require his assistance. The gang does sport some pretty sick costumes (check out the plungers on Larry’s head), but, in the end, “Supper Hero” is all style, no substance.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij4e111001l3g6b8pt4mmvv@published data-word-count=38><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> I collaborated on this one with a guy named Mark Steele. We were writing The League of Incredible Vegetables, which was a superhero theme with Larryboy that we expanded out into the rest of the Veggie characters.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki533zgx007h3g6f6pwena2o@published>36. ‘The Eight Polish Foods of Christmas’ (2011)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52fjf2001o3g6fv2zfwell@published data-word-count=70>Oscar is catering the VeggieTales Christmas party, and he has brought a cornucopia of Polish dishes, which he presents one by one in a parody of “The Twelve Days of Christmas.” I do not have a lot of familiarity with Polish cuisine, and I have no doubt that gołąbki and chruściki are delicious, but the way the animated food looks … let’s just say it does not do them justice.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij4ebhq001r3g6bkboe5j0m@published data-word-count=44><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> My grandmother is Polish; she emigrated from Poland and lived with us for a number of years. My dad was really into Polish Christmas traditions, so all those foods were foods that I grew up on, which are basically things wrapped around meat.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki535ji2007z3g6fgaxo29kq@published>35. ‘Bubble Rap’ (2012)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52fk21001q3g6fvudi9yhq@published data-word-count=120>Larry, Mr. Lunt, Junior Asparagus, and Jimmy Gourd form a boy band known as Boyz in the Sink (presumably a reference to the 1991 film Boyz n the Hood, which children in the mid-2000s are sure to understand). There are a few BITS songs ranked higher on this list, but generally I prefer Larry as a solo act. “Bubble Rap” is literally just about popping bubble wrap, and, sure, I enjoy squeezing those little plastic bubbles as much as the next person, but like … not this much. Also, recurring character Khalil swings by to drop a rap verse. Khalil is a blue half-worm, half-caterpillar. He is very disturbing to look at, and I do not like him at all.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij4i8w1001x3g6bteox7zcy@published data-word-count=44><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> We put out a questionnaire to VeggieTales fans asking “What would you like to see a Silly Song about?” We got a bunch of entries, and I got to pick one of them to do a song about, and it was bubble wrap.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki537sa6008h3g6fr0il5nl8@published>34. ‘Oh, Santa!’ (1996)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52fmue001s3g6fz3cswyu9@published data-word-count=91>It’s Christmas Eve, and Larry is eagerly awaiting the arrival of Santa, for whom he has prepared a plate of cookies. Instead of a jolly tomato in a white beard, however, he receives visits from a bank robber (huh??) and a Viking (huh???). This song is all over the place, and though randomness often breeds silliness, the premise of “Oh, Santa!” is just too bizarre to really work. The best part of the song is when an agent from the IRS comes knocking and gets the door slammed in his face.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij4ij0e00233g6bv85fnw0y@published data-word-count=107><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> This was inspired by my tax bill that was due that year. This was in the early days of VeggieTales. We were struggling with making payroll and surviving this business, and I was doing freelance work where you get 1099s and you don’t pay your taxes on them. So I got to the end of the year and I had this huge tax bill, and I was just really gripe-y with the IRS for having to pay all this money. I drained my bank account basically, and I was like, Oh man. I just felt like it was robbery. So this was directed at the IRS.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki53f85s00933g6f40maitnw@published>33. ‘Astonishing Wigs’ (2011)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52fq2o001u3g6f1llyp3jf@published data-word-count=74>Archibald, an uptight, monocled asparagus, is a consistent foil for Larry’s silliness, so it’s no surprise that his Silly Song solo is a bit of a bore. His segment is named “The History of Fashion,” and he regales us with a lackluster, long-winded lesson on Regency-era wigs. Also, these three random pigs show up in the middle of it. What are you even doing here, pigs? This is a show about vegetables, not bacon!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij4j66200293g6bka86mrua@published data-word-count=43><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> I was listening to NPR and they were interviewing some British guy, and he used the phrase “astonishing wigs.” I was like, I just love that!

He even brings it a present: a few new friends, in the form of a set of dentures. The effect of his newly toothy grin, though, is horrifying enough to send Bob fleeing. Sorry, Larry, but we gotta go with Bob on this one — your single incisor suits you much better.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij4kr46002r3g6bs1mmuctu@published data-word-count=32><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> This was all based on the visual gag of what it would look like for Larry to have real human lips with a mouth full of teeth.

Larry’s gift-wrapping abilities apparently extend to everything except his actual present. (Okay, so you can wrap up a cucumber but not a box, Larry?)

Tim did the voice for Blind Lemon Lincoln, who is a take on an actual blues singer, Blind Lemon Jefferson.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki5574pp00263g6f0tyt2u85@published>6. ‘I Love My Lips’ (1996)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52h9o3003i3g6fv5igpuml@published data-word-count=124>Between Larry and Kylie Jenner, it’s a real toss-up as to who loves their lips more. In “I Love My Lips,” Larry and Archibald use a therapy session to dive deep into Larry’s childhood traumas surrounding his lips, culminating in that time he got his lips stuck in a gate and had to go to lip rehab with this kid named Oscar, who got stung by a bee right on the lip. They couldn’t even talk to each other until the fifth week because both their lips were so swollen, and when Oscar finally start speaking, he only spoke Polish, but he taught Larry the word for lip: usta! This song is made doubly funny by the fact that Larry has no discernible lips.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij5e86a006r3g6bt2b07tp5@published data-word-count=89><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> I wrote “I Love My Lips” on jury duty. This was pre-laptop days, so I didn’t even have a laptop with me; I had a legal pad. It was right around the time I was about ready to get married and going through premarital counseling with my fiancée, now wife. We were going in, talking to the marriage therapist, so that whole scenario made its way into the song. I was thinking, What would it feel like for Larry to have abandonment issues about his lips leaving him?</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki55azzw002s3g6fydm1b6e7@published>5. ‘Sippy Cup’ (2009)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52hana003k3g6f8cuttj4f@published data-word-count=131>Sometimes the nonsense of a Silly Song can veer too far off course, but absurdity levels are perfectly calibrated in “Sippy Cup.” Larry is at a fancy restaurant and asks in a hopeful tone for some water … in a glass. But Larry has an, er, messy history, and the server declares the jig is up — he must use a sippy cup. The situation escalates up the chain, from the server to the busboy to the maître d’ to a courtroom judge, until the judge receives a call from the governor who grants Larry sippy-cup liberation. The busboy brings a glass of grape juice, the room grows quiet, all eyes are on him … and Larry fumbles it, spilling juice all over the patrons. Truly a tragicomedy of Shakespearean proportions.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij5fj1h006x3g6bn3zjhxda@published data-word-count=69><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> This was a collaboration with a good friend of mine, Steve Taylor. Steve came in with this absurd operetta, the issue of a sippy cup in a restaurant and Larry not being able to hold his water, as they say. I’ve written most of the Silly Songs, but there’s been about ten collaborators I’ve worked with over the years, and it’s fun to get new voices in there.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki55frhf003p3g6f05kfiokb@published>4. ‘Pizza Angel’ (2005)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52hd37003m3g6f0c13qmwb@published data-word-count=87>It’s been hours since Larry ordered a pizza, and they had a 30-minute-delivery guarantee … Larry gives one of his most stirring performances in “Pizza Angel,” a finely tuned wavering between hope and despair as he wonders what fate could have befallen his deep-dish darling. Turns out his door number was broken, and the pizza-delivery gourd got so hungry looking for him that he ate the pizza. The anguish in Larry’s eyes, the keening wail of his voice … it’s enough to make a grown man cry.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij5h7xh00733g6brjc9vtwv@published data-word-count=36><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> That one was really fun —&nbsp;a ’50s bebop kind of story.

Jean-Claude and Phillipe contain more charm and charisma in their tiny pea bodies than all of Hollywood’s glitterati combined. The two are here to teach us the latest dance craze, the Hopperena, which, as it turns out, is merely hopping from side to side. Archibald is at first disapproving of the Hopperena’s simplicity, but after the peas convince him to give it a try, he wholeheartedly embraces the trend. This Silly Song has everything: Jean-Claude and Phillipe being adorable! Archibald in bunny ears and slippers! Archibald acting silly!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij5hlcy00793g6b3mnk9sp9@published data-word-count=47><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> The “Macarena” was a big dance craze back in the ’80s. I thought it would be fun to do a poke at the ridiculousness of the “Macarena” combined with a way-too-simplistic dance.&nbsp;You hop to the left, you hop to the right, and that’s basically the dance.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki55kpm7004v3g6fiq19pgy2@published>2. ‘The Hairbrush Song’ (1995)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52hi3s003r3g6f0ae5bh6m@published data-word-count=119>One morning, Larry steps out of the shower and realizes he can’t find his hairbrush, sending him into an existential spin in which he questions his friends, his surroundings, and, most of all, himself. Larry’s as bald as a baby’s backside, a fact that Junior doesn’t hesitate to point out — what on earth could he be doing with a hairbrush? Eventually, Bob lets Larry know that he gave the hairbrush to the Peach since “He’s got HAIR.” Though Larry is saddened by the revelation, the Peach expresses his gratitude, and all’s right with the world. “The Hairbrush Song” is an undeniable classic; it was even voted “Silliest Silly Song of All Time” on The Ultimate Silly Song Countdown.&nbsp;</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij5hudi007f3g6bolyqxfd7@published data-word-count=69><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> “The Hairbrush Song” is the very first Silly Song that I wrote. I was in the shower and I couldn’t find my razor, so I started singing, “Oh, where is my razor?” I pitched it to Phil, and he was like, “You can’t sing a song about razors to little kids!” So I reimagined it as a hairbrush, which is much more kid friendly and just as fun.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cki55n12k00153g6f5tm312nf@published>1. ‘Endangered Love’ (2000)</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cki52hm7x003t3g6flozhgece@published data-word-count=83>“Endangered Love” represents the pinnacle of the form, the Platonic ideal of a Silly Song. Starring the capricious Barbara Manatee and her on-again, off-again paramour, Bill, the daytime drama Endangered Love drags viewers along a tumultuous emotional journey; at first, Bill dumps Barbara because she can’t speak French, and Barbara is left without a partner for the ball. But Barbara returns, having learned French (“Mais oui, je suis manatee! See?”), and it’s Bill’s turn to confess that — gasp — he can’t dance.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij5ik7m007p3g6b7x4wb51c@published data-word-count=58>Meanwhile, Larry is such a big fan of the show that he’s got his very own Barbara Manatee doll, with whom he twirls in a passionate tango — until Bob barges in on their alone time. “Endangered Love” clocked in at No. 10 on The Ultimate Silly Song Countdown, but it’s No. 1 in my heart. Oh, Bill!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckij5irdu00803g6b9rkr03vm@published data-word-count=99><strong>Nawrocki:</strong> Bill and Barbara were two folks who worked with us. Bill was somebody who worked in our marketing department, and Barbara was one of the animators. We just pulled them in and said, “Hey, can you sing this part?” And they were like, “Sure!” Initially, we had Larry watching an endangered-species cooking show on TV. But instead, we drew on this idea of a guilty-pleasure soap opera, so Larry is watching this ridiculous soap opera of these manatees in love, and he’s got this little stuffed animal that he’s in love with, and he does a little tango.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Every VeggieTales Silly Song, Ranked</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpaWdhZ3y1tMRmmZ6rpGLDprPGopytmZyawG6%2FyKWjsmWjpLuov4yrmKejlZl7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lyrics-you-broke-my-heart-and-tearing-it-apart.html><span>←</span><span>You broke my heart and tearing it apart lyrics</span></a>
