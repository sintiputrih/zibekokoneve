As per her LinkedIn profile, she also has a job as a mergers and acquisitions consultant at KPMG. Follow to find her on Instagram & TikTok (@lexicgoldberg).</strong></p><p>We get a thorough understanding of how love, relationships, and rights are never as simple as they seem because <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a>‘s <a href=#><strong>The Ultimatum: Queer Love</strong></a> truly lives up to its title in every manner imaginable. After all, the focus of this special show is a group of LGBTQ+ people as they openly confront the turning point in the road they’ve reached on the way to achieving future familial stability.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Lexi Goldberg</strong></a>, one of the cast members, has been dating her partner, <a href=#><strong>Raelyn Cheung-Sutton</strong></a>, for nearly three years and is more than ready to marry her. However, Raelyn is unsure if she wants to get married right now (or ever). Thus, Lexi gives her the ultimatum.</p><p>Meanwhile, many people have been interested to know more about Lexi, including her job. Well, here is everything you need to know about her.</p><p>Previously, we touched on <a href=#><strong>Tiff Der</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Papa</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Xander Boger</strong></a>.</p><h2>Lexi Goldberg Is a 25-Year-Old Delaware Native Who Is a Social Media Star as Well as Holds at KPMG: The Ultimatum ‘Queer Love’ Update!</h2><p><strong>Lexi Goldberg</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@lexicgoldberg</a>) from Netflix’s The Ultimatum: Queer Love is a 25-year-old influencer and social media star who was born and raised in Wilmington, Delaware. She has over 570k and 340k followers on Instagram and <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok</a> respectively. Given her massive profile and the fact that she is also an OnlyFans model, it wouldn’t be shocking if she mostly earns money through brand partnerships and internet advertising.</p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blurred-reality.com/storage/2023/05/lexi-goldberg-the-ultimatum.jpg alt="Lexi Goldberg from The Ultimatum is a 25-year-old social media star. blurred-reality.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>Lexi Goldberg from The Ultimatum is a 25-year-old social media star.<br>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Talking about her social presence in an interview with Bustle, she told,</p><p><strong>I’m exploring what social media means, doing&nbsp;TikToks, and just trying to live an authentic life. I feel like I’m coming into my own as to how I want to dress and how I want to present myself to the world. That’s been such a cool opportunity because I don’t know if I ever did that in coming into my own queerness.</strong></p><p>However, she also does a normal job. Lexi started working at Deloitte in 2019 after earning a double degree in accounting and business tax from the University of Southern California. There, she specialized in venture capital and private equity. She accepted her present position as a mergers and acquisitions consultant at KPMG in Orange County because she wanted to be more active “on the deals side of tax transactions,” as per her <a href=# rel=noopener>LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>Lexi credited her understanding of “the true meaning of perseverance” to achieving a black belt in Kempo Karate at the age of 11. She also mentioned previous job experience in debt collection, sports administration, and law.</p><p>In 2020, she shared about her coming out on her Instagram with the <a href=# rel=noopener>caption</a>,</p><p><strong>My coming out story was unlike many… it was a short three weeks between my realization, first kiss, and outing. But no matter how much I struggled, the love I feel now surrounded by friends, family, and a girlfriend who has made my life a better place makes me realize that the time spent not out couldn’t have been short enough….Over the past week, I’ve heard the stories of students at my high school who do not feel the support and comfort I have the pleasure of feeling each and every day. So in honor of them, I’m going to make sure that is changed because being proud of who you are is the best damn feeling in the world.</strong></p><p style=text-align:center><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/blurred-reality.com/storage/2023/05/lexi-goldberg-the-ultimatum-netflix.jpg alt="While Lexi wants to get married, Rae doesn't. blurred-reality.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><strong>While Lexi wants to get married, Rae doesn’t.<br>Image Source: Instagram</strong></p><p>Talking about her journey in the Netflix show, Lexi Goldberg was “130% ready” to marry her long-term partner of more than three years, <strong>Rae Cheung-Sutton</strong>, when she signed up for the show. But when it came to taking the next step, they didn’t agree. As she explained to Bustle, “My relationship was at a standstill, and I didn’t know what to do.” Of course, she gave Rae a marriage ultimatum.</p><p>Lexi and Rae are the youngest couple in the show. They initially met on Bumble and after spending a night together in West Hollywood decided to go their relationship ahead. Go watch the show on the streaming platform to know how their relationship turns into.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianKq%2Fs7HDZqmemZyewbp6wqikaKSVrbZus86lm5udopx6tbTEZqylrJmirrXBzGaorp2Vp3qtu9WeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paige-glenn-net-worth-175699.html><span>←</span><span>Paige Glenn Net Worth</span></a>
