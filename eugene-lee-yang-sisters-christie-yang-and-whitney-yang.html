This triad was formed at the company BuzzFeed in 2014. Subsequently, they separated themselves from the internet media company in 2018. They have ever since achieved great success, expanded their company, and now have multiple employees.</p><p>Now, because we have already told you that he has been dating <a href=#>Matthew McLean</a>, let us look at who his sisters Christie Yang and Whitney Yang are.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Eugene Lee Yang Sisters?</strong></h3><p>Eugene Lee Yang is the only son of South Korean immigrants Min-Yeong Lee and Jae-hong Yang. Yet, he does have two sisters, Christie Yang, and Whitney Yang. So, Eugene is the middle child with two siblings.</p><p>Also, Eugene seemed to have a very good relationship with his sisters.</p><p>While being busy in each of their life and career, these Yang siblings appear to be making time to reunite and rebond every now and then.</p><p>Their father, Jae Hong Yang is no more. Before he passed in August 2020 at the age of 75, he was a family medicine doctor in Austin, Texas and he had received his medical degree from Catholic University Medical College.</p><p>The deceased patriarch and the Yang matriarch, Min-Young, divorced when Eugene was 13. But looking back, Eugene says that this very separation helped each one in the family to go on to become way more open-minded.</p><p>Following the divorce, the late-Jae Hong married Brenda Jacks and his kids from his previous marriage also eventually got close to her.</p><p>In 2020, Eugene also opened up about his conservative, Christian, Korean mother’s journey in accepting his sexuality to the point where she became comfortable enough to start asking him about sexual positions.</p><p>So, you know, Eugene’s mom turned 71 in July 2022 and she does not look anything like it.</p><h3><strong>Meet Eugene Lee Yang Sister, Christie Yang</strong></h3><p>In the above picture, on the right-hand side of Eugene is his sister Christie Yang.</p><p>So, Christie is a mission-driven philanthropy attorney with a blend of law firm litigation and in-house experience. Throughout her career, she has had professional experience in commercial litigation and handling complex legal matters for Fortune 500 companies including Apple, Toshiba, and Osram.</p><p>The years 2002 – 2006, saw her study B.A. cum laude and Distinction in the Major, History of Art at Yale University. Then, between 2006 and 2009, she acquired her J.D. with honors from the University of Texas School. And only then was she able to get her license from the Supreme Court of the U.S.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Christie Yang Age</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Christie Yang celebrates her birthday on the 8th of August and that makes her a Leo. Also, she was born in 1983. So, she reached the age of 39 in 2022. What’s more, we now know that she is a couple of years older than her brother who turned 36 on 18 January 2022.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Christie Yang Job</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As per LinkedIn, Christie Yang continued to be employed full-time at Walton Family Foundation&nbsp;as a General Counsel, as of 2022.

So, Christie was likely married around that time. If she continues to be married today as well, this was not quite clear.</p><h3><strong>Meet Eugene Lee Yang’s Sister, Whitney Yang</strong></h3><p>Eugene Lee Yang’s sister Whitney Yang is younger than him. So, she is the youngest in the Yang family.</p><p>The “baby sister”, back in the day when Eugene&nbsp;<span class="_aacl _aaco _aacu _aacx _aad7 _aade">passed 20K IG followers said to him that he probably got them because of his dogs. This is an instance as to how Eugene’s family always keeps him in check.

According to her LinkedIn, she also has felt pride in advocating for the causes and people she believes in and excelling in preparation, rigor, and detail when solving challenging problems.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Whitney Yang Married?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Unlike her sister Christie, Whitney Yang had never been married before 2022. Yet she did seem to have had a special someone in her life for a very long time.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Do Eugene Lee Yang Sisters Reside?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>As of 2022, Christie Yang was living around Washington, D.C., and Whitney around Denver, Colorado. While they both and Eugene were born and bred in Pflugerville, Texas. Growing up there, the Yang family was among the few Asian Americans in their community. And Eugene precisely struggled with body image issues and low self-esteem as.</p><p>Despite that, the Yang siblings have always felt pride in listening to their immigrant <a href=#>parents</a>‘ stories — how they risked everything and worked tirelessly to give them a better life, and more.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Are Eugene Lee Yang Sisters On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Indeed.
