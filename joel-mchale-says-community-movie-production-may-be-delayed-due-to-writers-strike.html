However, as a result of the ongoing Writer’s Guild strike, we may need to wait just that little bit longer, according to series lead Joel McHale.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=true>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Collider</a> promoting McHale’s latest series Animal Control, the actor weighed in on the strike, saying he is 100% behind writers petitioning for better pay. In a follow-up question as to whether or not it would affect the Community movie, McHale more or less confirmed our worst fears, telling the publication he’s “guessing it’s not going to start on time.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>While it’s certainly upsetting to hear that the movie we’ve all been patiently waiting for may take a little longer to get off the ground, it’s important to remember that without well-compensated writers, we end up with a subpar final film or television show. We’ve waited eight years, what’s a few more months?&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=298 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Another project that has been impacted by the writer’s strike so far is Yellowjackets</a>, with more almost certain to follow in the coming days and weeks. Aside from McHale, stars such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Hamill</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Lowe</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brett Goldstein</a> have all been vocal in supporting the writers currently picketing.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooaidnGK6pLTApZxmq5GuwG6vzqakrqaZqcZuuc6voJ5loKe8pcHCraCopl2irrp5wZ5knZ2clsamsIydrJ5lpKR6uL7IrZyrq12owbO1yp5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./human-skeleton-found-on-uc-berkley-campus.html><span>←</span><span>Human skeleton found on UC Berkley campus</span></a>
