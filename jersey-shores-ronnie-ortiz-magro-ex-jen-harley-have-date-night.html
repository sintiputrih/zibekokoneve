I’ve been blessed to have been through more experiences than I could ever dreamed of,” the MTV personality captioned a series of pictures from the bash. “I’ve been blessed to have so many different gifts & blessing in my life. You think you have lived life when you have been through the things I’ve got to experience & go through. All of those things don’t even compare to the feeling I get when I laid eyes on her.

I wanted to be led to the place that I am now – that’s happy, healthy and the best role model for my daughter.”</p><p>Ortiz-Magro added of his alcohol abuse: “I think it’s a chronic disease. It’s a progressive disease. I’m still struggling. You stop and you start up again, and it’s worse than when you stopped. You’re just like, ‘Wow, I thought I had this under control,’ but at the end of the day, it has full control over you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnaKosrp50qGmq52jYr%2Bwus2inGanoqm2u3nMmp6rp12axW62xKdkoZmiobK6ecearZ5llJbBpnnNop6hrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./news-is-john-pork-real-person-tiktok-calling-meme-explained-reports-found-dead-atlanta-go-viral.html><span>←</span><span>Is John Pork a real person?
