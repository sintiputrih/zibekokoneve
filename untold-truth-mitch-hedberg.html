Mitch Hedberg had other ideas. In a 2004 <a href=#>interview with Las Vegas Weekly</a>, Hedberg claimed he was going to do much less, so people couldn't associate him with <a href=#>drugs</a> anymore. As he said, "You can't do copious amounts of drugs and stay alive ... so not all drug use has tapered off ... but I've learned just to stay under the radar." Basically, his plan was to moderate his drug use and not talk about it so much. Everyone would be happy, right? He also thought it might help his career, theorizing during that interview that since he got arrested for drugs once, any mistake he makes in the future will get blamed on drugs. So, to make himself look better, he was planning to do less drugs and be really quiet about the ones he did do.</p><p>He <a href=#>died</a> a year later — due to drugs — so unfortunately, his plan didn't work.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCkmpvbGelo8GwuMNmq6utpJ16rrXTnJ9moJWZr6a%2Bxmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-travolta-makes-first-official-appearance-after-oscars-flub-with-weird-goatee-201444.html><span>←</span><span>John Travolta's Goatee: Actor Makes First Post-Oscars Appearance</span></a>
