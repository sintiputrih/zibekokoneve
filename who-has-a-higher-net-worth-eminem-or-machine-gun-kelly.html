<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Eminem Or Machine Gun Kelly?</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Eminem-and-Machine-gun-kelyy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Throughout <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem</a></strong>’s career, he has made it a habit to have beef with many of his peers. In fact, Eminem has feuded with so many of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his fellow performers</a> that it seems like he revels in trading barbs with just about anyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Eminem is always ready to throw shade at anyone at a moment’s notice, some of his beef have definitely been a lot more noteworthy than others. For example, Eminems’ feuds with Ja Rule, Royce Da 5’9, Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon, The Insane Clown Posse, and of course, his mother and ex-wife have all stood out over the years.</p><p>Over the last few years, one of Eminem’s feuds has received a lot more attention than the rest, the one he had with Machine Gun Kelly. While it is fair to debate which of the performers prevailed lyrically, even though most give Eminem the win, there are other ways to compare the two enemies. For example, since both men are known to boast about their success, especially when feuding with others, it makes sense to compare Eminem and MGK’s net worths.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Timeline Of Hip-Hop's 18 Most Notorious Beefs</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mgk-s-receipts>MGK’s Receipts</h2><p>Over the last year, the main reason why Machine Gun Kelly has been in the news is that a lot of people are fascinated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his relationship</a> with the movie star Megan Fox. Of course, long before Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox were linked in public, he was one of the most successful musicians around.</p><p>One of those rare performers who can slide between musical genres, Machine Gun Kelly has recently managed to have songs perform exceptionally well on the rock charts. However, MGK is still best known as a rapper since he became a star due to songs like “Bad Things”. “Rap Devil”, “All My Best”, and “Til I Die”. Whether Machine Gun Kelly is releasing rap or rock songs, the point is that a lot of his songs have been hits and he has made a fortune because of that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of Machine Gun Kelly making money from his music, he has been shrewd enough to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diversify his career</a>. For example, MGK has become an actor who has appeared in movies like Nerve, Bird Box, The Dirt, and The King of Staten Island among others. Machine Gun Kelly has also penned endorsement deals, including one that has seen him promote Reebok’s Club C Sneaker. Unsurprisingly, celebrities agree to endorsement deals since they are very lucrative and Machine Gun Kelly is no different. In fact, it seems very likely that MGK’s Reebok deal played a key role in him amassing a fortune that celebrtiynetworth.com estimates to be worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$10 million</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Gun Kelly's Dating History Timeline</a></span></p><h2 id=a-once-in-a-generation-talent>A Once In A Generation Talent</h2><p>When Eminem first became a major star after the release of 1999’s “The Slim Shady LP”, it didn’t take long for everyone to respect his obvious rapping skills. However, since millions of fans first became aware of him because of his debut single “My Name Is”, it was pretty easy for less interested observers to see him as a joke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, over time Eminem would prove that he is among the best lyricists of his generation and his vocal skills deserved all of the respect in the world. As a result of Eminem’s popularity and his incredibly lengthy career, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone that he is one of the best-selling musical artists of all-time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Highest-Selling Hip-Hop Artists Of All Time</a></span></p><h2 id=eminem-s-empire>Eminem’s Empire</h2><p>Considering that Eminem has reportedly sold roughly 220 million albums during his career, it should go without saying that he is an extremely wealthy person. However, if you think that Eminem earned all of his wealth from record sales, that simply isn’t the case. After all, throughout Eminem’s career, he has toured the world performing which has earned him an incredible amount of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to the money Eminem has made from touring and his solo records, it also has to be noted that he has made a pretty penny from the D12 records he contributed to. On top of that, Eminem is the co-founder of Shady Records, a record label that has released albums from other talents like 50 Cent, Obie Trice, and Bad Meets Evil among others. Of course, Eminem has made money from each of the albums any artist released under his label.</p><p>Over the years, Eminem has also made money from the movie 8 Mile, all of the merchandise he has licensed, and other business ventures. Once you take all of the ways Eminem has made money into account, it makes sense that he is worth a lot more than Machine Gun Kelly is. Even still, it is pretty staggering that Eminem is worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$230 million</a> according to celebritynetworth.com when you compare it to MGK’s $10 million fortune.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent Credits Eminem For His Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddna60ecBmn6KfmJq%2FbrrErWSwp6KptW6xzKKlnqVdpL9uucCcn6KmlWK0trqMpJylpKlk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christopher-ruddy-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Christopher Ruddy Net Worth 2024</span></a>
