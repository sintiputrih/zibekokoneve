She first joined the team in 2007 as our weekend meteorologist and was most recently on the morning news with Mary Calvi and Chris Wragge. In September, Elise joined Cindy Hsu on the 9 a.m. newscast," the station wrote.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@JessicaMooreTV</a></figure><p>The statement also made it clear that Elise was a passionate colleague and ambassador for her community, and she was both a mother and a wife.</p><p>Although the statement was a loving tribute to a valued colleague, it didn't offer much in the way of the concrete explanations that many curious viewers were probably expecting. Instead, it was fairly quiet on the specifics.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Elise Finch's cause of death?</h2><p>The statement did say that Elise had died at a "local hospital," but it also added that her cause of death hadn't been determined yet.</p><p>Despite the lack of clarity around Elise's death, though, many of her colleagues and others who knew her well posted tributes to her on social media following the news that she had died.</p><p>“Elise was fiercely loyal to those she loved, a straight shooter, a consummate professional, and made me laugh until I cried,” WCBS anchor Jessica Moore <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Twitter</a>. “But above all she was completely devoted to her family, especially her daughter Grace. I love you so much, my friend.

Our team will never be the same,” WCBS anchor Chris Wragge wrote in his own tweet. “No one matched musical wits better. I’ll miss you much.”</p><p>“The song of her life deserved many more verses. Her gifts were many, and so too the lives she touched,” WCBS reporter Tony Aiello tweeted. “My deepest condolences to Graig and little Grace, her parents and sister, and all our CBS2 family."</p><p>New York Council Speaker Adrienne Adams also added to the list of tributes, writing about the loss the entire city has suffered due to Elise's death. “Elise served as CBS’ meteorologist for over a decade and graced thousands of households with her genius,” <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">she tweeted.</a> “She will truly be missed.
