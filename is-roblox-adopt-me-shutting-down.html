But is the game shutting down?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The 'Adopt Me!' devs confirmed on Twitter that the game is not shutting down.</h2><p>On June 27, the official Adopt Me Twitter account tweeted confirmation that despite a screenshot circulating that claimed otherwise, the game will not be shutting down.</p><p>"A fake screenshot is circulating on social media saying that Adopt Me! will shut down. I'm here to reassure you <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that is NOT true</a>!" the tweet reads. "We love Adopt Me! and we plan to keep our amazing updates coming every week for a long time to come. There's nothing to worry about!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though the game has faced various ups and downs over the years, including briefly going private in 2021, it seems that the developers have absolutely no plans to shutter the popular Roblox game.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Adopt Me' was briefly banned in two countries.</h2><p>Though the developers have no plans of shutting Adopt Me down, there was a time in September 2022 when the game was briefly shut down in both the Netherlands and Belgium to comply with the countries' new laws surrounding loot boxes.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“We want Adopt Me to be enjoyed by as many players around the world as possible. However, to comply with laws in the Netherlands and Belgium, access for players in The Netherlands and Belgium has been disabled,” the post read, per PCGamesN. “We will be attempting to change Adopt Me in these regions in order to allow access again in the future... Please remain patient and keep an eye on our social media pages for potential updates on this.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Thankfully, the game wasn't down very long, as the developers pushed out the required updates in October of that same year, allowing players to get right back into it.</p><p>"We have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">re-opened Adopt Me</a> to players from the Netherlands and Belgium!" the devs tweeted on Oct. 5. "Log-in soon to keep your streak! We hope you all enjoy the Halloween update!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There was previously a petition to shut down 'Adopt Me!'</h2><p>When you look at Adopt Me's history, it's understandable why players are concerned, as there was previously a petition to end the game.</p><p>On Oct. 10, 2020, Adopt Me! introduced a new update to its interface which gave massive upgrades to the game. Things that the upgrade included were a new fossil egg that users get to care for and raise, and 12 new pets to adopt, each with their own unique tricks. The game update also allowed users to wear accessories by finding fossils and dig up toys.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The new update was one that users were anticipating and looking forward to. Once the game started trending and more flocked to Adopt Me! to check out the new updates, the Roblox platform started to experience issues. Users were not able to connect, and Adopt Me! was blamed as the reason the Roblox platform servers went down.</p><p>People got so upset about Adopt Me having an impact on the servers that one person started a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org</a> petition to try and convince Roblox to remove Adopt Me! from the platform. "Clearly Adopt Me! is botting and every once in a while it breaks Roblox we need to stand up and fight for pour [sic] Roblox 24/7 uptime," the petition read.</p><p>Thankfully, the petition wasn't successful, and Adopt Me continues to live on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvs6bo6iwXZaxsLzTZqSeZaOdwrXAyKeeZpyfrLs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./exclusive-interview-debbe-dunning-is-back-in-action-packed-debbe-dunnings-dude-ranch-roundup.html><span>←</span><span>Exclusive interview: Debbe Dunning is back in action-packed Debbe Dunnings Dude Ranch Round-Up</span></a>
