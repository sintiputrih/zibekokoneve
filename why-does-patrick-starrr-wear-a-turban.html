Patrick is a prime example.</p><p>According to Patrick, his struggle with hair loss began in high school. Things only worsened as he grew older. Although Patrick didn’t name his health condition, the symptoms he described sound a lot like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">alopecia</a>, which is most often triggered by stress. Eventually, Patrick had to make the tough decision to shave his head.</p><p>Some of his former co-workers at <a href=#>MAC</a> put him onto headwraps and he hasn’t gone back since.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>"Also, I feel like it's kind of like my cape and kind of like Mickey Mouse ears to the beauty community,” he said in a YouTube video titled “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">My Biggest Insecurity</a>.”</p><p>Patrick added: “And also it's branding for me — it's my staple. It's been in all of my MAC campaigns and multiple beauty campaigns on commercials and TV, so it's kind of a part of me."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While the accessory makes him feel better about going bald, Patrick said he still hasn’t “found the confidence to go without a turban” in public. But he was forced to when it came time to take his state board exam to become a licensed esthetician.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Patrick was asked to remove his turban for his Esthetician State Board Exam.</h2><p>Patrick is no rookie to the beauty industry, so it’s no surprise that he went ahead and took the state board exam to become a licensed esthetician. He secured the credentials, but not before he was forced to remove his turban against his will.</p><p>“As soon as I get into the testing center, the lady immediately said, ‘Take your turn off and put it in a locker.' And I was like, 'OK.' And they told me to sit down and take my picture,” Patrick recalled. Although he pleaded that she let him wear his turban for his ID photo, his efforts were made in vain.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Patrick was told that he could retake the picture with his turban on if he passed his test, which, of course, he did.</p><p>He said that he was traumatized by the incident, but in the end, he was just happy he got his license.
