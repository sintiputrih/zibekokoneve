Kazarian has now taken to Twitter to reflect on his choice, describing it as both difficult and necessary while encouraging others to take similar steps in their careers.</p><p><a href=#>In his tweet, Kazarian stated</a>:</p><p>“In January I made a difficult, but VERY necessary decision. I decided to bet on myself. It resulted in the most rewarding, successful & overall fun years of my career. I urge all of you who may be in a similar situation that action speaks louder than words. Don’t talk it, walk it.”</p><p>Kazarian’s departure from AEW marked a significant move in his career, and it’s clear from his words that he views it as a positive and transformative experience. His message serves as a reminder that sometimes taking bold steps and believing in oneself can lead to remarkable personal and professional growth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What are your thoughts on Frankie Kazarian’s decision to leave AEW and return to IMPACT Wrestling?
