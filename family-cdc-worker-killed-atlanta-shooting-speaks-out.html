"She was driven by compassion, both in her work in the field of maternal mortality, and in her everyday life. Amy was selfless always, she wanted more for others but never for herself. Generous supporter of worthy causes, she was the social conscience of our family."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">St. Pierre worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Reproductive Health, according to CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"She worked every day to save lives of mothers and infants," Walensky said at a Senate HELP committee hearing on Thursday.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/ef2de165-1f85-40f5-a203-90ec6f166ad9/victim-ht-ml-230504_1683207982654_hpMain_1x1.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra said in a statement Thursday, "Our hearts go out to her husband Julian St. Pierre, her children, and all her loved ones at this difficult time.

Family came first," she added.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">St. Pierre's family said, "She will be missed but never, ever forgotten."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Becerra added, "We are all still trying to process this heart-breaking news. But there is no escaping that gun violence is tearing the American family apart and has become a public health crisis."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Four other women were shot in Wednesday's mass shooting and survived.
