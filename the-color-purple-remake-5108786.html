After 11 Oscar nominations and a slew of Tony nods, the heart-wrenching story of a group of Black women in the South during the early 1900s is returning to the screen with <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>American Idol</a>&nbsp;winner&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Fantasia Barrino</strong></a> leading the cast.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In addition to Fantasia, The Color Purple features more all-star actors you know and love like <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taraji P. Henson</strong></a>. A new trailer was released on October 10 and confirmed what we already know: The Color Purple is sure to be the movie event of the holiday season. From the cast to the release, here’s everything you need to know about the upcoming film.</p><h2>When Is The Color Purple Remake Coming Out?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Fans will get a holiday treat this year! The Color Purple will debut in theaters on December 25, 2023. The movie will be released exclusively in theaters. Other hit musicals have been released on Christmas Day in the past, including Dreamgirls, Into The Woods, and Les Misérables.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The 1985 film version debuted around the holidays as well. Sadly, the Spielberg-directed classic would go on to hold the record for the film receiving the most Oscar nominations without a win alongside 1977’s <i>The Turning Point. </i>We expect a much brighter future in store for the musical version come the 2024 Academy Awards!</p><h2>Who Will Be In The Color Purple Remake?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>Fantasia</strong> played Celie Harris during The Color Purple’s original Broadway run from 2007 to 2008, and she was initially hesitant to take up the role again after she had a challenging time with it. “My life at that time was all over the place,” Fantasia recalled to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>. “So, carrying Celie’s weight and my weight was not fun. And I remember saying in interviews and radio stations, when they would ask me, I said, ‘Well, I did it, but I’ll never do it again.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Luckily, a producer convinced Fantasia that she was the only one who could do the role proud. “It’s going to be absolutely amazing,” she added. “I’m glad that I didn’t allow that door to close. I talked it over with my whole entire family and everybody kept saying, ‘I think you should do it.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>Phylicia Pearl Mpasi</strong> plays the young version of Celie in the film. This will mark her onscreen debut.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ciara</a></strong> will be playing the adult version of Nettie Harris, Celie’s sister. It is art in motion. Fantasia is Celie, and I play Nettie, and the younger Nettie is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Halle Bailey</strong></a>, and so, I mean, the cast is incredible,” the singer said on The Jennifer Hudson Show in December 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Following her amazing performance as Ariel in the live-action version of The Little Mermaid, Halle will be on the big screen again as the younger Nettie. “Getting to be a part of The Color Purple is such an amazing moment for me, I feel, because it’s such a staple, that film, in our community in particular,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>. “So, I remember my grandparents would always have it playing in the background. And I was just really excited, not only because I’m such a fan of the women that are in it… It felt like a fun family, like you’re at a family reunion. You love seeing all your aunties and cousins, it literally felt just like that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>She continued, “I was excited to play young Nettie because I felt I had experience of sisterhood, that bond that I have with my sister <strong>Chloe [Bailey]</strong>. I felt like I was able to pull from my experiences with her and apply it to the beautiful relationship between Celie and Nettie. Even though Nettie goes away for almost half the film, she’s gone, but you feel her love and that thought of her and Celie.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-color-purple-trailer-embed-1-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>The cast also includes <strong>Taraji P.

God is so good. Here’s a few of my fav moments without showing too much,” she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-color-purple-trailer-embed-2-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-25>During one of her final days on set, <strong>Fantasia</strong> witnessed a beautiful rainbow. “Rainbow is hovering over us today onset,” she began. “The last color happens to be ‘Purple.’ I can’t wait to sit down and tell you guys the stories from this Amazing Story and Woman I’ve played for 6 Months and grown to know so very well. @kingofbingo you covered me even in the hard times( Mister).”</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>She continued, “5 more days and Mrs. Celie and I will part ways but I’ll take so many memories and lessons with me.
