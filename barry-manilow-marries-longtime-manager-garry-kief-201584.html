You can only come into my world if I invite you in. From the very beginning that was the rule,” he continued. “I learned how to deal with the publicity/press thing. You just say, ‘I’m not interested in talking about [that].’ Even the names of my dogs! They are my kids, my friends are my friends and my family, they are mine. That’s the only way I can survive. I have to keep that to me. I don’t want strangers knowing everything. If that happened, that would drive me crazy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>This is the second time Manilow has walked down the aisle.
