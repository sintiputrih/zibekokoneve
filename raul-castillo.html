Raúl lived close to the US-Mexican border due to which his parents often visited their family members living in Reynosa, which he describes as living ‘very much bicultural.’ According to him, he identified himself as American when he visited Mexico, but Mexican when he traveled across the United States.</p><p>I was too American for Mexico, but too Mexican for the U.S.”</p><p>He did his schooling at Our Lady of Sorrows School in McAllen and McAllen High School. He started acting when he was fourteen years old. During his time at McAllen High, he turned to the theater to make friends because the theater was popular in his hometown. He was deeply involved in his high school drama department. In 1999, he graduated with a major in theater from the College of Fine Arts, Boston University. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_1><a href=#>[1]</a></span> At the university, he started producing his own work and viewed himself as more of a writer than an actor, despite his performing abilities. In 2002, he moved to New York City. He was initially planning to go to Los Angeles but chose New York after he was stuck in a rush-hour traffic jam in Houston and realized he could not deal with daily traffic if he moves to LA.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span><span style=color:purple>Physical Appearance</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Height (approx.):&nbsp;</strong>5′ 11″</p><p><strong>Eye Color: </strong>Black</p><p><strong>Hair Color:&nbsp;</strong>Black</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Raul-Castillo-1.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_Ethnicity_Relationships></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_Ethnicity_Relationships></span><span style=color:purple>Family,</span>&nbsp;<span style=color:purple>Ethnicity & Relationships</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He is a Latin American. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_2><a href=#>[2]</a></span> He was raised in a catholic household. <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_3><a href=#>[3]</a></span></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_Siblings></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_Siblings></span><strong>Parents & Siblings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Raúl Castillo was born to Raúl H.

He considered himself a playwright more than an actor and wrote plays for student-run playwright’s festivals. Most of his early plays were focused on sociopolitical and racial tensions on the border of Mexico and the United States. One of his plays produced at the student festival was ‘Border Stories,’ a trio of one-act plays chronicling the life on the U.S.-Mexican border in Reynosa. After moving to New York, he joined the LAByrinth Theater Company as a writer and remains a resident writer for LAByrinth. His play ‘Knives and Other Sharp Objects’ debuted in The Public Theater as part of LAByrinth’s works in development in 2009 and talks about class, race, and assimilation in South Texas.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/A-scene-from-Knives-and-Other-Sharp-Objects.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-64215 class=wp-caption-text>A scene from Knives and Other Sharp Objects</p><p>The play received moderate reviews.

My brother is the skinny one and my sister is the girl! It is actually a term of endearment in Spanish which is funny because fat in English has such a negative connotation.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>Despite having a bicultural upbringing, he said that he had always felt American while growing up. He further stated that he and his siblings were considered ‘gringos’ (a foreigner from the perspective of Spanish and Latin speaking people in Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries in Latin America) when they visited Mexico. He identifies himself as a Mexican-American.</li></ul><ul><li>When he was in grade three, he attended his brother’s school production of the play ‘The Wizard of Oz’ in which his brother was cast as ‘Tin Woodman.’ After seeing his brother perform, he became interested in acting. His older brother also played guitar and was a hardworking musician according to him. Watching his brother’s dedication towards music as he played scales for hours, he was inspired to dedicate himself the same way to acting.</li></ul><ul><li>The next year, he auditioned for his school’s play ‘about a mouse and a clock,’ but was unable to get through due to his excessive giggling; he was cast in a non-speaking role as a guard in the play as a result.</li></ul><ul><li>In his grade six at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic School, he met and became friends with Mutemath bass guitarist Roy Mitchell-Cárdenas. Talking about Roy in an interview, Castillo said,<br><p>One of my closest friends is Roy Mitchell-Cardenas and he plays bass for a band called Mute Math. We met in the 6th grade. We started a band together and before I got into theater, I played bass in a couple of punk rock bands with him. &nbsp;Roy and I started off together, he played drums then, and I, bass. To this day whenever his band plays in my home base of New York, we get together, hang out and I go see his shows. The last time he was in town he played at Madison Square Garden with Alanis Morissette and that was very nice to see. Our career paths have kind-of taken off together, so yes that friendship is pretty strong.”</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Roy-Mitchell-Cardenas.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-64219 class=wp-caption-text>Roy Mitchell-Cárdenas</p></li></ul><ul><li>Together with Roy and other two friends Nick Trevino and Robert Vleck, he started an underground punk-rock band called IPM (short for Influential Phecal Material) in high school. While Roy played drums in the band, Castillo played bass guitar. The time at the beginning of his band, he made his mind to become a rock musician. According to him, he was put on the back burner in the band. By the end of his high school, he had started to get serious about theater due to which he was kicked out of his band. Talking about it in an interview, he said,<br><p>I was in high school, in my second band, I played with my brother actually and I was starting to get more serious about theater. I was a Junior in high school and I knew that I wanted to apply to theater schools and get out and see the world. I was in a drivers education class at the time and the radio was on and they were mentioning local shows and they mentioned my band but I have no idea we were playing that gig…turns out they kicked me out of the band because they knew I was getting serious about theater.”</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Raul-Castillo-playing-with-his-band-members-at-a-band-reunion-party.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-64221 class=wp-caption-text>Raúl Castillo playing with his band members at a band reunion party</p></li></ul><ul><li>In his high school, he played his first acting role in the school’s production of Paul Zindel’s play’ The Secret Affairs of Mildred Wild.’ He also performed in his high school production of ‘I Remember Mama.’</li></ul><ul><li>At the age of fourteen, he met and befriended Tanya Saracho, an alumna of McAllen High and the story editor for Looking (2014). Castillo was heavily influenced by Tanya who introduced him to playwrights and dramas. Talking about Tanya, he said,<br><p>Another good friend of mine is Tanya Saracho, a Chicago playwright. &nbsp;I’ve known her since the age of fourteen, we met in high school, went to college together and to date we remain really good friends.”</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Raul-Castillo-with-Tanya-Saracho.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-64222 class=wp-caption-text>Raúl Castillo with Tanya Saracho</p></li></ul><ul><li>According to Castillo, the 1993 film ‘Carlito’s Way’ changed his interests completely. The performances of John Leguizamo, John Ortiz, Viggo Mortensen, and Luis Guzmán influenced him. He even memorized several of Leguizamo’s plays such as Spic-O-Rama, Mambo Mouth, and Freak.</li></ul><ul><li>Castillo also found inspiration from several Hispanic artists in the media, including Miguel Piñero, who he discovered when he was looking across a yellowed anthology of work from Nuyorican Poets Cafe, an art theater in New York City, for a monologue competition. The actors such as Al Pacino and Anthony Quinn also influenced him a lot.</li></ul><ul><li>After studying at Boston University, he went to Austin, where he acted in short films and also helped start a theater company. He worked at a coffee shop in Austin called Spider House, which also owned a video store. As an employee there, he could rent as many videos as you wanted. He watched a ton of movies and was impressed by directors. That’s when he decided to be an actor on television and in films. Talking about it in an interview, he said,<br><p>I just fell in love with directors in the same way that I fell in love with playwrights. Once I did my first short film as an actor and I figured out that I could do it, I knew I wanted to do more of it and I knew I wanted to find directors who had a vision and who I could collaborate with to express a singular vision. Television has a lot of cooks in the kitchen. It is a lot of people and I know film could be that way too but I don’t think television can ever have what film and theater have in that sense. There are a lot of opinions that go into it. To be honest, most of the television I have done was with filmmakers.”</p></li></ul><ul><li>He is also a guest teacher at Heidi Marshall Studio, an acting school in New York City.</li></ul><ul><li>In an interview, he has discussed his interest in direction. Castillo finds himself inspired by actors turning into directors. According to him,<br><p>I think there is a lot I have to learn. I think down the line, yes. I would like to get more experience. I see people like America Ferrera and Gina Rodriguez turning into directors and it is something that leaves me in awe. I am in awe of these ladies turning to directing and I am very inspired by them. Right now I am enjoying being an actor!”</p></li></ul><ul><li>According to him, his dream role would be to play a musician. He said,<br><p>I would love to play a singer, or any kind of musician. I would train to do that role, I would love to play someone that’s going to teach me. I never know what I want until I see it in front of me. There are so many characters out there that I am sure would excite me. For me, its got to be new and fresh, its got to challenge me in all the right ways. A lot of people got exposed to me as an actor through the HBO show Looking which was different from my character on We The Animals which is exciting for me. I just want to continue portraying a variety or roles.”</p></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=References></span>References<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul class=wpusm_ref_ol><li id=refid_1><a href=# class=jump_ref>1</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>The New York Times</a></li><li id=refid_2><a href=# class=jump_ref>2</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>The New York Times</a></li><li id=refid_3><a href=# class=jump_ref>3</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>Gozamos</a></li><li id=refid_4><a href=# class=jump_ref>4</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>The Imagista</a></li></ul><h3>Related posts:</h3><a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Isla Johnston Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Isla Johnston Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Richard Cetrone Wiki, Height, Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Richard Cetrone Wiki, Height, Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Devon Terrell Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Devon Terrell Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Calahan Skogman Wiki, Height, Age, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Calahan Skogman Wiki, Height, Age, Family, Biography & More</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamZy7ornEm6CoZpOkunC%2BwK6jZpuRqMGquMuoZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./juan-thornhill.html><span>←</span><span>Juan Thornhill | Fan Arch</span></a>
