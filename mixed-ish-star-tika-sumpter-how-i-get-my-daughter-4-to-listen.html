You made me very mad.’ I love that because that gives them an emotional IQ so that I’m not guessing anymore.”</span></p><p class=x_p1><span class=x_s1>Sumpter also got real about parenting during the quarantine.</span></p><p class=x_p3><span class=x_s1>“I have an amazing support system, which is my fiancé, Nick.

I think we’re made to feel guilty in some way about that.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Mixed-ish-Star-Tika-Sumpter-Trick-For-Getting-Her-Four-Year-Old-To-Listen-Inline.jpg><p class=x_p3><span class=x_s1>Sumpter has since learned to take a time out and has partnered with Dunkin’ and Planet Oat to celebrate their Oatmilk Latte and Oatmilk Iced Lattes, and to encourage “pressing pause and giving yourself a nice treat.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=x_p1><span class=x_s1>When she gets time for herself, Sumpter said: “I like to meditate.
