Or did they go their separate ways too? We sifted through any clues that may suggest their current relationship status – and got the lowdown from Brock himself.</p>BridTV4695Vanderpump Rules | Season 9 First Look Trailer | Bravohttps://i.ytimg.com/vi/5kL6EYPdGBY/hqdefault.jpg856408856408center22403<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-are-scheana-and-brock-married-yet>Are Scheana and Brock married yet?</h2><p>No, Scheana and Brock are not officially a married couple yet. With so much of their relationship in the public eye, including their engagement recently being aired, it’s likely they would have shared pictures of their special day.</p><p>Brock exclusively told Reality Titbit:</p><p>I call Scheana my wife and I have done so for sometime. We are happily engaged and we look forward to our wedding later this year when our families can celebrate our love together.</p><p>They have shared their wedding plans in the past, which involves not wanting a massive ceremony due to both having been married in the past, and wanting a smaller celebration.</p><p>While Brock had picked the venue, the plans fell through, so he turned to co-stars LaLa and Randall to help him. He actually wanted Randall to throw a fake movie premiere that everyone had to attend, as a surprise wedding!</p><p>The plan was for Brock to propose to Scheana before the ceremony happened – right there. This left fans confused when the proposal went ahead, but no signs of a wedding took place.</p><p>Despite their original decision to get married in Bali in November 2021, the ceremony didn’t go ahead due to the coronavirus pandemic restrictions. We look forward to seeing their wedding this year!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pump-rules-are-they-still-together>Pump Rules: Are they still together?</h2><p>Yes, Scheana and Shay are still an engaged couple. One reason for their wedding-to-be involved Australian-born Brock marrying Scheana for a green card, so that he can stay in the United States.</p><p>They have both agreed they are not setting an exact wedding date for now, and that their vision will get “clearer” as time continues. And looking at Instagram, the couple seem happier than ever.</p><p>Scheana revealed that they have not travelled to Australia due to quarantine rules (which currently involves two weeks in hotel isolation upon arrival), while <a href=#>Brock shared a recent picture of them with their daughter</a> on the beach.</p><p>There are no signs that they may not be together, despite several rumors doing the rounds online.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Unpopular opinion: I like Brock a lot.
