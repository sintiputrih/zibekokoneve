This past May, Stamos and Abdul, 53, <a href=#>posed for a photo </a>together. “Cold Hearted Snake and America’s sweetheart. Together again and it feels so good,” Stamos captioned the Instagram pic, referencing Abdul’s 1989 hit “Cold Hearted.” The song was rumored to be about Stamos, but the actor finally revealed the truth on WWHL.</p><p>“That song was written before I met her,” Stamos said. He joked: “It should have been [about me].”</p><p>Stamos — who was married to <strong>Rebecca Romijn</strong> from 1998 to 2005 — still has game with the ladies. He previously said that women often ask for <a href=#>selfies after having sex,</a> and he’d rather give a woman 10 orgasms in one night than enjoying one himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“What is the highest number of orgasms that you’ve given a woman in one evening?” Cohen asked. Stamos replied: “I plead the Fifth. You have to ask the women, I don’t know.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The actor kept mum about the topic, but he did say that he’s currently not in a monogamous relationship — and that age is just a number.</p><p>“Just as long as they’re female. Really — [and legal],” he added of his dating age range, with a devilish grin. “Whatever age appropriate is.”</p><p>Watch the video above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5ijerTAwKamrGWjlsa0eceeZKGZlGKubrPRnpitZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq4tdOhZJytpJp6sa3UpZhmmZKZwq15kWlobmphZXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jake-gyllenhaals-new-thriller-is-now-streaming-on-netflix.html><span>←</span><span>Jake Gyllenhaals New Thriller Is Now Streaming On Netflix</span></a>
