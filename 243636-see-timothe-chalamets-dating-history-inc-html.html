Most notable amongst his relationships was his well-publicized romance with iconic actor Johnny Depp's daughter Lily-Rose Depp.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>TIMOTHEE CHALAMET'S RELATIONSHIP</strong></p><p class=dh>Lily-Rose Depp was born in France, and she is the oldest child of actor Johnny Depp and singer Vanessa Paradis. Lily-Rose has enjoyed a relatively successful acting career, and she is also a Chanel brand ambassador.</p><p class=dh>Chalamet and Lily-Rose reportedly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a28896923/timothee-chalamet-lily-rose-depp-relationship/>began dating</a> in late 2018, after meeting while filming Netflix's "The King." The two made several public appearances together and were famously photographed sharing a kiss in the rain during an outing in New York.</p><p class=dh>Nearly a year later, Chalamet and Lily-Rose were spotted together at the film's premiere during the Venice Film Festival. Following the premiere of their movie, the pair went on a vacation to Capri, Italy.</p><p class=dh>In Italy, they were photographed enjoying a steamy kissing session on a boat. The photos generated a media storm, with many describing the vacation photos as a PR stunt by the duo.</p><p class=dh>Meanwhile, Chalamet maintains that such claims could not be further from the truth. Despite all the drama surrounding the pictures, Chalamet still recalls the moment fondly. During a recent interview, the 24-year-old actor <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.gq.com/story/timothee-chalamet-november-2020-cover-profile>gushed:</a></p><p class=dh>"I went to bed that night thinking that was one of the best days of my life. I was on this boat all day with someone I really loved,...'That was great.'"</p><p class=dh>The last pictures of Chalamet and Lily-Rose together were from September 2019.

Despite the photos, neither of them came out publicly to confirm or deny the dating rumors.</p><p class=dh>However, Chalamet's <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a34519522/timothee-chalamet-eiza-gonzalez-break-up/>surprising summer romance</a> with the "Baby Driver" actress was short-lived, and by fall, the two were reportedly no longer an item.</p><p class=dh>Apart from Gonzalez and Lily-Rose, Timothee Chalamet's dating history has also seen him romantically linked with veteran singer Madonna's daughter Lourdes Leon. In fact, that was his first known high-profile romance.</p><p class=dh>The two reportedly met while attending LaGuardia High School in New York City. According to several media reports, Chalamet and Lourdes began their romance in 2013.</p><p class=dh>Even though the two are no longer an item, they have still maintained a close friendship.

She subsequently landed a role in the 2014 Christopher Nolan science-fiction film "Interstellar."</p><p class=dh>In 2017, Chalamet finally landed his breakthrough role in the dark comedy "Call Me by Your Name." He received critical acclaim for his role in the film and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor.</p><p class=dh>Since then, the 'Interstellar" star <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.gq.com/story/timothee-chalamet-november-2020-cover-profile>has built up</a> an enviable career in the movie industry and is currently regarded as one of Hollywood's most promising young stars.</p><p class=dh>Chalamet's unique good looks have undoubtedly made him one of the most loved actors of the present generation.
