According to the story behind his unusual name, his parents wanted to be surprised by his gender. Her mother saw him when he was born, and his lips formed a heart shape. That is when Hart’s name was created.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no reliable information about his mother or father. He is secretive, explaining why so little is known about them to the general public. Denton is fortunate to have two sisters, Gray Denton and Paten Denton, and a younger brother, Haze Denton.</p><h2>Hart Denton Height, Age, and Body Measurements</h2><p>There is no doubt that Hart is one of the industry’s hottest male models and actors. As a model, this fashionista stands at 5 feet 11 inches (180.5 cm). He revealed in an interview that he is training under the supervision of Alex Fine.</p><p>This actor accomplishes one thing after another in a short period due to his perseverance, determination, and passion. He is the one who instilled in Denton the importance of exercise as a way of life. He was able to make a significant change in a month. Hart now has the hot six-pack abs that every guy desires.</p><p><strong>He has maintained his weight at 163 pounds, or 74 kilograms.</strong> Moving on, his vital statistics remain unknown to the general public. However, we will update it as soon as possible.</p><p>His white skin complexion enhances whatever he wears, particularly in high fashion brands. He is naturally blonde, and his mesmerizing green eyes are the icing on the cake. This hot model prefers shoe sizes 11 (US), 10 (UK), or 44 (EU) (EU).</p><p>Every year on June 20, Denton celebrates his birthday. Not to mention, Hart was born in the year 1993. He will be 27 years old in 2020, and he was born under the sign of Gemini. This sign’s people are said to be caring, loving, and humble.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Hart1.jpg><h2>Hart Denton Education and Childhood</h2><p>This dashing young man grew up in the United States of America with his parents and siblings. His parents dressed him as the legendary singer and songwriter Elvis Presley when he was four months old. Not to mention that Hart is a huge music fan who aspires to make a name for himself in the industry.</p><p>In terms of education, Denton attended Conway Senior High School. He later earned his bachelor’s degree from Belmont University. Furthermore, Hart is of white ethnicity and is of American nationality.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Unlike other models or actors in the industry, this American man experienced adversity. Hart relocated to Los Angeles, California, on May 1, 2014. Denton lived with a girl who was his childhood colleague because he didn’t have a place to live. He used to sleep on the floor on card boxes in which his friend’s mattresses had been delivered at the time.</p><p>During his time in Los Angeles, this talented model would take a three-hour bus ride from Valley to Hollywood. That continued for a year. Furthermore, he did not sign up to be a model; he was discovered.</p><p>Initially, he googled each agency’s address and phone number and called them. Except for Click Management, every agency eventually rejected his proposal. At the time, the only photographs he had were those taken by his mother and sister. He was holding a puppy in that photo, born in a garage.</p><p>Hart immediately signed a contract with Wilhelmina after sending some fantastic pictures to them after Click. Who is brave enough this time to ignore his smoldering eyes and chiseled face? He has appeared on the cover of Icon Magazine as a model. Surprisingly, Next Model Management was the one to turn him down.</p><p>Hart has previously promoted high-end brands such as Dior Homme, Louis Vuitton, Bottega Veneta, Versace, Cerruti 1881, and H&M. He has collaborated with well-known fashion designers like Alexander McQueen and Cody Sanderson.</p><p>Finally, he was allowed to work on the well-known teen drama Riverdale. There, he played Betty Cooper’s half-brother Chic Cooper. That certainly drew a lot of positive attention from the media. Denton has also appeared in the film Lethal Weapon. It is also his major break in the film industry.</p><h2>Hart Denton Girlfriend & Dating</h2><p>With his smoldering eyes and cheeky smiles, this chiseled face model grabs everyone’s attention. With these characteristics, it is simple to win any woman’s heart. But Hart can only be in love with one woman, and that lucky lady is none other than Sunny Soofiani. Not to mention that she is a well-known model.</p><p>The Riverdale cast had a deep bond, and the lovey-dovey couple used to hang out a lot. In the year 2017, they were madly in love with each other. Harts never missed an opportunity to mention his passion in an interview or on social media.</p><p>Their adorable romantic relationship quickly became the talk of the town. Unfortunately, this actor was involved in a car accident in September 2018. Sunny was the one who rushed to the scene at the time. Fortunately, Hart escaped that tie unscathed. The couple has a beautiful puppy named Cobain.</p><p>The duo made no statements or claims to the media. Their relationship, however, did not have a happy ending. When they stopped posting about each other on Instagram, fans realized something was wrong. September of 2018 was the year.</p><p>Unfortunately, this 27-year-old model has not been involved in any rumors or controversy. He isn’t married or engaged. But we can tell Hart is having a happy and lavish single life with a high profile.</p><h2>Hart Denton Net Worth</h2><p>There was no turning back for this versatile actor once he entered the fashion industry. He soon became involved in the film industry as well. We can’t even guess how much money Hart made from his role as Chic in Riverdale. <strong>Denton, a stunning actor, has an estimated net worth of $2 million in November 2023.</strong></p><p>In addition, Hart appreciates the extra cash he receives from photoshoots, ad campaigns, brand endorsements, and other ventures. However, no accurate information about his annual income or assets is available. This Riverdale actor appears shy and unwilling to share important information with the media.</p><p>Whatever the case, we fans are relieved to hear that he is continuing to pursue his career with zeal. All we want for him is a happy life ahead of him.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifmqqkYrWmutOopWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./frederic-forrest-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Frederic Forrest Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
