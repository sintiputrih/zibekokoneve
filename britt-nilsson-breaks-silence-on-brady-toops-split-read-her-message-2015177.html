<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Britt Nilsson Breaks Silence on Brady Toops Split: Read Her Message</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>No more paradise for these two! Bachelor alum <strong>Britt Nilsson</strong> <a href=#>opened up about her split</a> from boyfriend <strong>Brady Toops</strong> in a lengthy Instagram post on Friday, July 17. The reality star — who lost The Bachelorette title to<strong> Kaitlyn Bristowe</strong> this season — revealed that she and Toops actually parted ways a while ago.</p><p>“Yes, it is true–@bradytoops and I are no longer together. We had a wonderful, sweet, and life-giving relationship that I appreciated, learned from, and thoroughly enjoyed. Brady is one of the most genuine, godly, encouraging, generous, kind, intelligent, and all-around amazing men on the planet,” Nilsson, 27, <a href=#>captioned a pic</a> of the twosome.</p><p>“We broke up about two months ago, but still remain very close friends. I couldn’t be more blessed by who he is as a person — I will forever respect and adore him,” she continued. “We feel that God brought us into each other’s lives for a purpose so we continue to support one another in all we do.”</p><p>Nilsson previously fell for <strong>Chris Soules</strong> in Season 19 of The Bachelor. She and Toops met when he was a contestant during The Bachelorette’s Season 11. (The Nashville songwriter picked up his guitar and left the series to be with Nilsson after the majority of his competition chose to move on with Bristowe as their leading lady.)</p><p>“Thank you for being so kind and caring as our journey unfolded on tv. We love you guys, and appreciate your investment in our relationship,” Nilsson added. “Just because we didn’t work out romantically doesn’t mean we don’t continue to value and love each other as brother and sister in Christ! We communicate candidly & frequently and will remain in each others lives as great friends. It was always a beautiful, honest, and valuable relationship, and continues to be.”</p><p>The ABC series often gave updates about the L.A. waitress and Toops after their exit. But on Monday, July 13, any pre-taped packages were left on the cutting room floor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I believe that everything happens for a reason and our relationship made us both stronger! He is an incredible man of faith who gives great advice, loves God and people well, and blesses everyone around him just by being himself,” Nilsson wrote. “I truly can’t wait to see all the great things in store for him! I will ALWAYS be #teambrady! So, thank you for your support and encouragement, continued prayers, and mostly for respecting our private decisions and the (finally) public outcome! LOVE YOU GUYS!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Toops also spoke out about their breakup with a <a href=#>similar Instagram post.</a> “We both immensely enjoyed getting to know each other, and I’m grateful for the beautiful moments we got to share,” he wrote on Friday. “It was obviously such a unique and unusual experience starting in front of the Bachelor mansion and eventually airing in front of millions of people, but I honestly want to say that everything I did, said, & felt for Britt on the show was genuine & real. In getting to know her away from all the cameras, lights, & microphones, I truly got to see how special she really is.”</p><p>He continued: “From the first moment she stepped out of the limo on Chris Soules’ season, I was in. Britt was the whole reason I decided to do the show in the first place, and even though it didn’t work out in the end, I have no regrets. Honestly, I would have done it all over again.”</p><p>Like Nilsson, Toops learned a lot from the relationship. “Britt is one of the loveliest, kindest, and most caring persons I have ever met, and she added so much to my life,” he gushed. “In a world that can often times move too fast, Britt helped me see the beauty in every moment.. the smell of the flowers, the sight of the sunset, & the simple pleasures of life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmpwW66yKWqrKeeYq%2BzscCkqmarmaGyr6%2FEZqanZZKnrqXFjK2mqKijYsCxuMitZKudkZl6qbHRZqSeq6OWtKZ5kWlobmlnbHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./farmhouse-farro-salad.html><span>←</span><span>Autumn Farmhouse Salad</span></a>
