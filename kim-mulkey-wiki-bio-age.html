She also won gold medals at the Pan-American Games in 1983 and the Olympics in 1984. In 2005, 2012, and 2019, she coached Baylor to three NCAA titles.</p><p>In addition to being elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Kim was also inducted into the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Untitled-design-5-300x300.jpg.webp><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mulkey_Early_Life_and_Education></span><strong>Kim Mulkey Early Life and Education</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>One of the first girls to play organised baseball with boys in the United States was Kim Mulkey. She led her Hammond High School basketball team to four straight state titles after playing basketball at Nesom Junior High School in Tickfaw, Louisiana. She graduated from high school as valedictorian with a flawless 4.0 GPA. Due to her success in the classroom at Louisiana Tech, she eventually received high academic accolades and was inducted into the College Sports Information Directors of America Academic Hall of Fame.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mulkey_Professional_Career></span><strong>Kim Mulkey Professional Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A two-time national champion as a player, Kim Muley, whose height is 5 feet 4 inches, was an All-American point guard for Louisiana Tech University.

Under her leadership, Louisiana Tech had a 430-68 record and made it to seven Final Fours throughout her 15-year career as an assistant and associate head coach under Leon Barmore. In the year 1988, Kim Mulkey and the Lady Techsters were the NCAA Champions.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mulkeys_National_Basketball_Career></span><strong>Kim Mulkey’s National Basketball Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kim Mulkey was chosen to compete for the United States in the Caracas, Venezuela, Pan American Games in 1983. To win the event’s gold medal, the team had to win each of its five games. Mulkey scored 12.4 points a game on average.</p><p>Mulkey competed for the USA National team at the 1983 World Championships in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The squad defeated the Soviet Union twice while losing two of its six games. The USSR team won by one point, 85-84, after the USA team led by nine points at halftime, but the Soviets rallied to retake the lead. The USA team’s final shot failed to fall, giving the USSR team the win.</p><p>The following four games were won by the USA team, setting up a matchup with the USSR for the gold medal. There were only six seconds left in this game when it was knotted at 82 points apiece. The Soviet team won the gold medal with a score of 84-82 when Elena Chausova received the inbounds pass and made the game-winning shot in the dying seconds. The silver medal was won by the American team. Mulkey scored 3.1 points a game on average.</p><p>For pre-Olympic training, the USA sent its national squad to the 1984 William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. With an average victory margin of well under 50 points per game, the squad convincingly defeated each of the eight opponents they faced. 6.8 points were Mulkey’s average per game.</p><p>To represent the US at the 1984 Olympics, she continued to train with the national team. To win the gold medal, the team had to win all six games. Kim Mulkey scored 5.3 points in each contest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Untitled-design-1-300x300.jpg.webp><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mulkeys_Coaching_Career></span><strong>Kim Mulkey’s Coaching Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kim Mulkey took over the Baylor programme in 2000 after the team’s 1999–2000 campaign, which saw them finish 7–20 overall, worst in the Big 12 Conference, and without ever having been invited to the NCAA tournament. Since Mulkey’s arrival, the Lady Bears have participated in postseason play each year. In her first season at Baylor, she guided the team to its first NCAA tournament bid.</p><p>Every year, they win at least 20 games, and the squad has only ever had more than 10 losses in a season once. The national championship was won by Baylor in 2005 after the Bears’ victory against Michigan State in the Indianapolis championship game marked the culmination of the program’s growth under Mulkey. She is now just the fourth person and the first woman to have won NCAA Division 1 basketball championships both as a player and head coach.</p><p>Kim Mulkey has participated in every year’s NCAA women’s tournament since it began in 1982, except in 1985 and 2003, as a player or coach.

Mulkey led the Lady Bears to a flawless 40-0 season in 2012, the most victories in men’s or women’s collegiate basketball history, and she established NCAA history. The Lady Bears’ victory over Notre Dame in the NCAA Championship Game in Denver marked the season’s conclusion.</p><p>The Baylor Lady Bears beat the Notre Dame Fighting Irish by a score of 82-81 in Tampa in the 2019 NCAA Championship game, which was a rematch of the championship game from 2012. With three or more NCAA Division I women’s basketball titles, Mulkey became just the third coach to accomplish this feat.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mulkeys_Career_during_the_Pandemic></span><strong>Kim Mulkey’s Career during the Pandemic</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The COVID-19 epidemic forced the cancellation of the 2020 NCAA tournament, but Baylor advanced to the Elite Eight in the 2021 tournament, which was hosted in an event isolation bubble. Despite the ongoing epidemic, Mulkey argued for the stoppage of COVID-19 testing on the competitors during the Elite Eight round. She spoke candidly during a news conference without being prompted by reporters, saying that the group in charge of organising the student tournament needs to stop using the COVID tests.</p><p>The statements were made by Mulkey after her team’s defeat to UConn. Mulkey had tested positive for the virus earlier in the season. The opponent that Baylor was slated to play earlier in the season was postponed due to Mulkey’s COVID diagnosis. According to CBS News, several basketball fans afterwards referred to her remarks as risky, reckless, and uninformed.</p><p>Later, Geno Auriemma, the head coach of Connecticut, defended Mulkey’s remarks, saying that the previous year had shown them that there were many tough subjects to discuss. On April 25, 2021, Mulkey was named head coach at LSU after serving as Baylor’s head coach for 21 years.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mulkeys_Autobiography></span><strong>Kim Mulkey’s Autobiography</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kim Mulkey wrote her autobiography.

She once donned a snakeskin pattern for a game versus Connecticut. Her attire selections have elicited a variety of passionate reactions online.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mulkeys_Son_Husband_and_Family></span><strong>Kim Mulkey’s Son, Husband and Family</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Kim Mulkey was born on October 10, 1962.

She also regretted saying that the best response to being urged not to send a daughter to Baylor is to strike someone in the face.</p><p>Kim Mulkey regrets using the statement about hitting them in the face, Mulkey added. She said it wasn’t meant literally, but she was only attempting to make a point about how Baylor players should respond to them with firmness. She doesn’t like to be violent. She expresses regret for her terrible word choice.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Untitled-design-2-300x300.jpg.webp alt="Kim Mulkey" width=356 height=356 sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Here is the full bio/wiki of Kim Mulkey, her name, age, height in feet, weight, body measurements, nickname interests/hobbies, Basketball, boyfriend, spouse, cars, house, hometown, ethnicity, birthplace, parents, achievements, school, her Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok earning/income/net worth, zodiac sign, sports, education, caste, religion, date of birth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mulkey_Information_Table></span><strong>Kim Mulkey Information Table</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table><tbody><tr><td>Real Name</td><td>Kimber Duane Mulkey,</td></tr><tr><td>Nickname</td><td>Kim Mulkey</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Former Basketball Player, Head Coach</td></tr><tr><td>Height (approx.)</td><td>in centimeters-163 cm<p>in meters-1.63 m</p><p>in feet inches-5′ 4″</p></td></tr><tr><td>Weight (approx.)</td><td>in Kilograms-Not Known<p>in pounds-Not Known</p></td></tr><tr><td>Figure Measurements (approx.)</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Colour</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Colour</td><td>Blonde</td></tr><tr><td>Date of Birth</td><td>10 October 1991</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as in 2022)</td><td>60 years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>United States</td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac sign/Sun sign</td><td>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Hometown</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Higher Education</td><td>Hammond High School</td></tr><tr><td>Educational Qualification</td><td>Bachelor degree</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christian</td></tr><tr><td>Ethnicity</td><td>White/Caucasian</td></tr><tr><td>Caste</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Address</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Hobbies/Interests</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Divorced</td></tr><tr><td>Affairs/Boyfriends/Girlfriends</td><td>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Sexuality</td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Father-Not known<p>Mother-Not known</p></td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Brothers-Not Known<p>Sisters-Not known</p></td></tr><tr><td>Husband/Wife/Spouse</td><td>Randy Robertson</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1-5 million</td></tr></tbody></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Untitled-design-2-300x300.jpg.webp><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mulkey_Social_Media></span><strong>Kim Mulkey Social Media</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><a href=#>Facebook link</a></p><p><a href=#>Instagram link</a></p><p><a href=#>Twitter link</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibiography.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Untitled-design-3-300x300.jpg.webp><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mulkey_Lesser_Known_Facts></span><strong>Kim Mulkey Lesser Known Facts</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li>When Kim Mulkey returned from the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, where she assisted Team USA in winning a gold medal, the Village of Tickfaw dedicated a boulevard in her honour.</li><li>Kim is the only person in NCAA history to have won national titles as a player, assistant coach, and head coach.</li><li>Mulkey was one of the nine individuals elected into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2020.</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kim_Mulkey_FAQs></span><strong>Kim Mulkey FAQs</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>What is Kim Mulkey’s net worth?</strong></p><p>Kim Mulkey’s net worth is between $1-$5 million.</p><p><strong>Who is Kim Mulkey?</strong></p><p>Kim Mulkey is a former Basketball player.
