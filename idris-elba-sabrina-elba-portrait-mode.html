Throughout the episode, the two nonetheless create quite decent renderings of one another—all while discussing their favorite podcasts, working together as a couple, and the ingredients that make up a strong bond.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Read on for more highlights on their wise chat together from this episode of Portrait Mode down below.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">On what inspired their Coupledom podcast …</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While embarking on their journey to lifelong partnership, the couple has been particularly intrigued by the pillars that comprise the most successful partnerships—from Kim and Kris to Ben and Jerry. “We found ourselves looking at partnerships and why they worked, and we found that we could actually build a little bit of a community of people that choose to work together, whether it be siblings, whether it be marriage,” Idris shares. “We really found ourselves leaning in to why partnerships did so well.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Their Audible podcast has been an opportunity for them to meet with other inspiring partners—in romance, business, or otherwise—and learn more about what in particular has made their bonds successful. “It’s just so great to have open conversations with people where you can discuss what went right but also what went wrong and be vulnerable in the moment. And I love that we have the opportunity to do that now, because as newlyweds, we have so much learning and so much growth,” Sabrina says. “We had a great conversation with a friend at the beginning of our relationship who had been married for 25 years, and he’s like, ‘You guys, you’re a drop in the bucket.’ So much happens in that time, so this is so much of a learning experience and growing experience for us to be inspired and to be educated in some way by speaking with friends and people we don’t know.”</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">On their favorite types of podcasts …</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sabrina shares that she’s all for true crime—the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.swordandscale.com/category/podcast/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sword and Scale" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>Sword and Scale</u></a> podcast in particular. “Anytime we’re on a road trip, I’m like, ‘Can we listen to this murder,’ and Idris is just like, ‘No,’” she says, to which Idris affirmatively responds, “No murder, no destruction—Jesus.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Idris, on the other hand, doesn’t have a go-to genre so much as his individual picks, such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/revisionist-history/id1119389968 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Malcolm Gladwell’s Revisionist History" data-vars-ga-product-id=53f461fe-e31a-4c18-bf1d-78f907d4c3ef data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/revisionist-history/id1119389968 data-product-url=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/revisionist-history/id1119389968 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpodcasts.apple.com%2Fus%2Fpodcast%2Frevisionist-history%2Fid1119389968" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/afflink/UCaB/apple-revisionist-history-on-apple-podcasts","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","network":{"name":"Skimlinks"}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=105f66b5-080a-4ccc-8ba8-1a0885874953 class="body-link product-links css-1xesb7e e1aq0z090"><u>Malcolm Gladwell’s Revisionist History</u></a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://dissectpodcast.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Dissect class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Dissect</a>—though he shares that, unlike Sabrina, who “listens to podcasts every time she drives somewhere,” he began to appreciate the medium after they started their own show. “Since doing our own and really getting into what it takes to make a great podcast, I’m actually really more intrigued by it,” he shares.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">On partnering in business with a significant other …</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Contrary to popular qualms, Idris and Sabrina are in full support of blending romance with business; they think it’s a special opportunity to enhance—or otherwise condition—a significant bond. “There are so many great things that come out of loving someone that really you can attribute to being a business partner,” Idris says. “It isn’t easy—it makes life a little bit more sensitive sometimes, because you’ve got a lot of pressure as you’re working but you also love each other, but you can attribute some real great things like trust.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Don’t be afraid to take risks,” Sabrina adds. “If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work—that’s just a part of life. What went wrong and what doesn’t work out is such a growing experience for so many of us.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Scroll up for the video to see their full chat.
