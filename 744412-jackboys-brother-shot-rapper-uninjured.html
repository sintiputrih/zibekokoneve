He was immediately airlifted to a nearby hospital, and is now said to be in "serious" condition. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">The suspect</a>, who's not yet been identified, fled the scene in a vehicle. Previous reports suggested that Jackboy had been shot, but the artist told Urban Islandz that it was his sibling shortly after the news began to circulate.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Preliminary investigation revealed that a young adult male was in his driveway when the suspect approached him and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">shot him several times</a>," local authorities shared on Facebook. "This appears to be a targeted attack and there is no immediate threat to the surrounding community," they also added. "Please avoid the area as there is a heavy police presence." It remains unclear what prompted the shooting.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jackboy-s-brother-in-serious-condition>Jackboy's Brother In "Serious" Condition</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fans are hoping that Jackboy's brother will make a full recovery following the attack. As for the former <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kodak Black</a> affiliate, he recently found himself in some <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">hot water</a> after rapper Lexxstasy accused him of domestic violence. “He would beat the sh*t out of me," she alleged on Instagram Live. "Spit on me, made me sit in the shower butt-a** naked with a fan on, in a sixty-degree house. [He] would make me suck d*ck or f*ck him after he beat my a** bloody, bruised, eyes damn near shut."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The performer later insisted that their relationship was "not like Chrisean [Rock] and Blueface." This <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">prompted a fiery response</a> from Chrisean, who made it clear that she didn't appreciate the reference. "Jack boy shut yo ugly a** up," she responded. "What I got to with you beating ya b*tch up if I was her both of us would have black eyes not just her with ya small a** n ya dreads would be pulled out … and dats ain’t how u say my name either tf."
