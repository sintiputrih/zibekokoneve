Basically, his <a href=#>net worth</a> is double the amount of <a href=#>Kiss</a> co-founder <a href=#>Paul Stanley</a>, and even more than former and current members of the band (via <a href=#>Roll and Roll Garage</a>). So how did Simmons out earn them by so much?&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Outside of music, Simmons invested his money in a lot of different industries and is a very successful entrepreneur. He co-owns a chain of 25 restaurants called <a href=#>Rock and Brews</a>, which was co-founded with Stanley, has his own beverage called <a href=#>MoneyBag Sodas</a>.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Along with royalties, he's also still making a lot of money with the Kiss brand, having licensed it to thousands of different products, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Inc. Magazine</a>. Kiss merchandise can be found anywhere. Their iconic stylized band name and tongue logos are etched onto anything from collectibles and clothes to toys and household items. As a result, the smart branding decision has helped them make a billion dollars in Kiss merchandise sales, reported Inc. Magazine.&nbsp;Despite several public trademark fails, per&nbsp;<a href=#>Vice</a>, Simmons still has quite a few significant ones that he owns (including his infamous tongue, of course).&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Simmons also recently invested $300,000 into cryptocurrency (via <a href=#>Yahoo! Finance</a>) and has shaped himself to be a financial expert of some sort. In 2014, he released his book titled <a href=#>Me, Inc</a>. where he discusses investments and becoming an entrepreneur.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Flm9rcmhfqbWqv4yiqmaflaOybr%2FIpqSopqNiwLa%2Bz6ugrKGenHqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marvel-star-samuel-j-jackson-praises-wife-shocking-health-battle.html><span>←</span><span>Samuel L Jackson praises wife of 41 years for giving him a 'chance' after shocking health battle</span></a>
