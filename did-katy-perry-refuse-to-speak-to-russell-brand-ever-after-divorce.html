Their relationship came to an abrupt end when Brand informed Perry of his decision to divorce her via text message.</p><p>Following their divorce, Brand married Laura Gallacher in 2017 and welcomed two daughters. On the other hand, Perry got engaged to Orlando Bloom on Valentine's Day in 2019 and celebrated the birth of their daughter, Daisy Dove, in August 2021.</p><p>However, Brand is now facing serious allegations, and there have been inquiries into whether Perry was aware of the real truth behind the situation leading to her divorce from Brand.</p><h2 id=katy-perry-admitted-that-she-doesn-39-t-speak-with-her-ex-husband-russell-brand>Katy Perry Admitted That She Doesn't Speak With Her Ex-Husband, Russell Brand</h2><p>Over the years, Katy Perry and Russell Brand have openly discussed their marriage. Perry has shared her thoughts on the end of their relationship, revealing how much she missed Brand and even reflecting on their marriage in her 2012 documentary Part Of Me.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Is-Katy-Perry-Jealous-Russell-Brand-Has-Kids-With-Someone-Else_-(1).jpg><p>According to Metro, Perry and Brand no longer have any communication. They don't have children together, and there's no reason for them to remain in each other's lives.</p><p>During her cover interview for Vogue in June 2013, Perry didn't hold back when she described her relationship with Brand as something far from a teenage dream. She acknowledged Brand's intelligence and charisma, stating, "He's a very smart man, a magical man, and I was in love with him when I married him."</p><p>However, she also revealed the challenges they faced in their marriage. She explained how, initially, he wanted an equal partner but later seemed uncomfortable with her taking charge, especially while on tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar52390318-1.jpg><p>This shift was hurtful and controlling, according to her. Perry added, "Let's just say I haven't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me on December 31, 2011. I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth. I let go, and I was like: This isn't because of me; this is beyond me. So I have moved on from that."</p><p>In 2015, speaking to the Sydney Daily Telegraph, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perry reiterated that she hadn't had any contact with Brand</a> since he informed her of his intention to file for divorce. "... I don't want to talk about him - my songs will say what I need to say," she told the publication.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres Forgot About Katy Perry's Marriage To Russell Brand And It Was Clear That Perry Wanted That Part Cut Out Of The Interview</a></span></p><p>Perry also revealed that she poured the pain from their sudden breakup into her fourth studio album, "Prism". She explained that she expressed all her emotions through her music and described the divorce from Brand as "emotionally traumatic" and the "death of a dream" during subsequent interviews as per Billboard.</p><h2 id=katy-perry-can-39-t-stand-being-in-the-same-room-as-ex-husband-russell-brand>Katy Perry Can't Stand Being In The Same Room As Ex-Husband Russell Brand</h2><p>During her studio appearance guesting in 2010, Katy Perry had quite the reaction when she came face to face with someone who resembled her ex-husband, Russell Brand. According to AceShowbiz, Perry had a startling reaction upon seeing this lookalike.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/th-image-template-12-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The situation was a prank orchestrated by BBC Radio DJ Scott Mills. Unaware of the couple's marital difficulties, the radio host thought it would be humorous to surprise Perry with a doppelg√§nger of her former husband during an interview.</p><p>Recalling the incident to The Sun newspaper, Mills explained, "I thought it would be funny to hire a Russell lookalike. I found a guy who, when he arrived, really resembled Russell and could mimic his voice. So we introduced the fake Russell into the studio - and Katy had an extreme reaction and hastily left."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did Russell Brand Give Up His Divorce Payout From Katy Perry?</a></span></p><p>"We didn't know they were having relationship troubles, so it was a bit misjudged. But I remember hearing her saying, 'I'm not going back out there,' multiple times. I pleaded with her to come back. She's wicked and did, but she said, 'You need to play my records for the rest of your life on the radio to make up for it.' It was my most awkward moment on Radio 1." Mills continued.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=russell-brand-revealed-his-chaotic-relationship-with-katy-perry-during-their-marriage>Russell Brand Revealed His Chaotic Relationship With Katy Perry During Their Marriage</h2><p>In Katy Perry's 2012 documentary, there's a glimpse of the challenges she and Russell Brand faced due to her demanding touring schedule. Perry shared with Vogue her struggle to maintain her marriage as Brand refused to join her on tour. After their divorce was finalized in February 2012, both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brand and Perry individually addressed the reasons behind their separation.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/th-image-template-10-2.jpg><p>During an interview with Howard Stern on his Sirius XM show, Brand suggested that Perry's reluctance to have children played a pivotal role in their marriage falling apart. "... I was really into the idea of marriage and having children." He acknowledged Perry's youth, success, and dedication but emphasized that the experience of marriage and parenthood was something she couldn't fully grasp until she lived it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the trailer for his 2015 documentary, BRAND: A Second Coming, the comedian also made light of the challenges of being a "vapid, vacuous celebrity" while married to Perry and the intense public scrutiny they endured.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/th-image-template-11-2.jpg><p>In 2017, Brand spoke compassionately about Perry, particularly regarding the pressures they faced as a couple. During an appearance on the U.K. show John Bishop in Conversation, he reflected on their busy lives and the unique challenges that fame presented. "The marriage didn't last for a very long time, and I think that is to do with the undulated nature of fame and that, living in those conditions and what was happening," he stated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Katy Perry Once Dished Out $200,000 To Launch Russell Brand Into Space!</a></span></p><p>In August 2023, Brand discussed again his previous marriage with Perry on an episode of Running Wild with Bear Grylls: The Challenge. "Some aspects of it were, like, amazing‚Ä¶ and it was kind of incredible to live for a moment in that eye of the cyclone-type aspect of fame. Aside from my sort of feelings of affection for Katy, it's a time that I remember being a little bit chaotic and a bit, for me, to speak for myself, a little disconnected."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoK61xYypnKuqqWK%2FprLUrJxmrJ9iwLGxwKRkraddp8K0v8Slo2aaopa7pXnEr5yrZZGbwaa%2BjJ2gr6eimLJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./today-in-history.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>What Happened On December 13th</span></a>
