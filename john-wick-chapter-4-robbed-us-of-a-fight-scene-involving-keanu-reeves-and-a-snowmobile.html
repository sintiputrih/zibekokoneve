I’m thinking nunchucks and snow,” Lee recalled of her early conversations with Stahelski.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=372 data-injectable=false>“‘Have you seen what they can do with snowmobiles these days?’ And I was like, ‘Okay, we have a movie.’” Though audiences were ultimately robbed of what sounds like a momentous-yet-chilly sequence, Lee said the idea was enough to get “the wheels in [Stahelski’s] brain spinning.” She continued: “we were off to the races at that point.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=875 data-injectable=true>As to why the scene was left on the cutting room floor, Lee said the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic allowed extra time for her and Stahelski to assess which fight sequences were most practical for the film — which managed to squeeze <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">140 of Wick’s kills </a>within its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">169-minute runtime</a>. “Then there was COVID, but the good or the bad of it was that it gave us also some more time to develop the script and work on it,” Lee said. “We had a little bit more time in between than we normally do.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>While the somewhat bizarre choice of fighting vehicle might not have made an appearance in the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> recording-breaking box office </a>Chapter 4, Lee teased <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">elsewhere in the interview</a> that a snowmobile will be involved in some capacity in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ballerina</a>, the upcoming spin-off starring Ana de Armas. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blonde</a> actress will portray an assassin looking to exact revenge on the people who murdered her family, with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">release date scheduled</a> for either summer or spring of next year.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Reeves will make <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a cameo appearance</a> in Ballerina, which marks one of two spin-offs currently in the works. The Continental, a three-part prequel miniseries exploring the hotel for assasins which Wick patronizes in the movies, will premiere in September, with a cast that includes the likes of Mel Gibson, Colin Woodell, and Peter Greene.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooaignmLEqq%2FKZpqhmaCpsrN5k2apqJqSmrFuwdJmpp9lkWKzqrPHrWSsm5Wjsm61za%2Bmpa6Zo7Rut8Sapa5lopqyt7HSZpinnF2WerS6zrCkqJqZobJw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-gianni-paolo-gay-what-is-the-sexuality-of-an-american-actor-627104-html.html><span>←</span><span>Is Gianni Paolo Gay?
