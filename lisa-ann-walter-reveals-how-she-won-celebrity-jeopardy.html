You have to wait [on the show] until they read the last word of the question and then [jump on the buzzer] immediately. And if you’re early, you’re locked out,” she revealed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lisa-Ann-Walters-258.jpg><p>Walter shared that the other contestants get a chance to answer if you buzz too early, and only if they are incorrect do you get the chance to buzz again.</p><p>“I’m always just confused as to exactly what they’re asking me,” added <span><a href=#><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a></span>. “Is that because they couch the questions in a way where you’re like, ‘Wait, do they want the name of the actor, or the show, or what?’”</p><p>Despite the confusion and high-pressure stakes, Walter navigated through the game and clinched victory with a million-dollar final answer.</p><p>Reflecting on her win, Walter shared a heartfelt moment when she felt her late mother’s presence during the last question.</p><p>“The final Jeopardy question where I won — the other two people were ahead of me because they had the buzzer thing down, but they got it wrong, they both got it wrong,” Walter said.</p><p>The question related to a 1930 <strong>Mary Roberts Rinehart</strong> novel entitled The Door, and when Walter heard the first part of the question, she panicked and was sure she wouldn’t know the answer.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“But it said, ‘What four-word literary trope became famous because the guy killed the mistress?’ It’s the butler! The butler did it,” she said.</p><p>“My mother was a teacher and read up to four mystery novels at a time. She came to me, in that moment. First time she’s visited since she died by the way — and she was like, ‘The butler did it,’ and I won a million bucks.”</p><p>Walter’s season of Celebrity Jeopardy! concluded in January and her winnings were donated to The Entertainment Community Fund.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOiq5Firq%2B6jLCYpayVp3qzsdWemKWrXZ28uHnSoZxmr5%2BjeqSxy56Zq6Gkrnqrsc6pmKucqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jirayu-tangsrisuk-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-353154-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jirayu Tangsrisuk Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
