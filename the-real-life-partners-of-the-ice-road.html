The two's body language hinted they were more than just friends as did her caption, where she wrote, "Like ya lots." Her "Roswell, New Mexico" costar Jeanine Mason seemed excited for her making it IG official with her man since she commented, "Well this is too much for my sister heart!" Thomas even shared the same caption on his own Instagram <a href=#>post</a> but posted different photos of him and Midthunder canoodling.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>According to <a href=#>CBC</a>, Thomas is a co-host of the <a href=#>"Foxing Around" podcast</a>, where he highlights stories of Indigenous people. Both Thomas and Midthunder are both members of tribes and are passionate about representing Indigenous people in the mainstream.&nbsp;"To have a native character and have it be female and strong I think it just important for native people to see,"&nbsp;Midthunder explained in <a href=#>Interview</a>.&nbsp;"For my family, or people on the reservation, I think that the more we see our own people doing things that we want to do, the more it breaks down the mental barrier to access."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb25oa4Z3e9OhnGaqlZa5brjIn5xmqJGnwa%2Bx0axkqJ5dqbWmecicnGaqn5axcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tabby-brown.html><span>←</span><span>Playboy Model Tabby Brown Wiki, Age, Obituary, Parents, Boyfriend, Height and More</span></a>
