I miss being Gabby; she was so fun, and she said and did things I wish I could say and do.” However, when quizzed about the possibility of a Desperate Housewives reboot, Longoria said she isn’t sure they “could do the show today” because “we’d get canceled.”</p><p>“I mean, not canceled on TV but like canceled in culture because it was so groundbreaking and we said and did so many things that were shocking at the time,” the actor explained. “I don’t know where these ladies would be now in their life.” Longoria went on to share that the show’s creator, Marc Cherry, also doesn’t have any interest in reviving the drama as “he feels like we fully explored these characters.” She continued: “That’s Marc’s big, big thing; he’s like, ‘Why now?’ He doesn’t want to reboot just to reboot.”</p><p><a href=# class=T3D>Desperate Housewives</a> enjoyed a hugely-successful eight-season run between 2004 and 2012, and centered on the ladies of Wisteria Lane: Gabrielle Solis (Longoria), Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher), Lynette Scavo (<a href=# class=T3D>Felicity Huffman</a>), Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross), and deceased neighbor Mary Alice Young (Brenda Lee Strong), who narrated the lives of the show’s core four.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Peter "Hopper" Stone/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images)</p></figure><p>The Emmy-winning series became a hit with viewers and critics alike, and speaking to Entertainment Tonight, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Longoria recalled “pinching” herself</a> when she first signed on to the show.</p><p>“I remember reading the script and going, ‘Well, this will never go,’ because it was so different.
