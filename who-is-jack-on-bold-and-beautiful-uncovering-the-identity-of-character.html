It makes sense that some viewers might be curious about who plays Jack Finnegan.</p><h2><strong>Who is Jack on Bold and Beautiful?</strong></h2><p><strong>Ted King will start playing the role of Jack Finnegan on The Bold and the Beautiful on July 30, 2021.</strong> Finn’s parents traveled to Los Angeles in 2021 to see their future grandson. With the arrival of newborn Hayes Finnegan, seasoned actor Ted King will debut on The Bold and the Beautiful as Jack Finnegan, Finn’s father on.</p><p>Being the father of Dr. John “Finn” Finnegan, Jack Finnegan naturally wanted to attend his son’s nuptials to Steffy Forrester. He thus traveled to Los Angeles with his wife, Li Finnegan to see their new grandchild, Hayes and to take part in Steffy and Finn’s nuptials.</p><p>Regrettably, Jack was showing a lot of nervousness and was clearly hiding something from the couple. A veiled woman arrived at the ceremony, and Jack attacked her. He seemed strangely relieved that it was Pam Douglas!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jack-Finnegan.jpg><p>When Sheila Carter stormed the celebration to admit that she was truly Finn’s birth mother, the truth was made known throughout the reception. But Jack’s knowledge of his son’s biological mother’s identity wasn’t his only secret.</p><p>He is also Finn’s birth father, a fact Sheila used to threaten him into allowing her to visit her grandson. Naturally, Steffy was not pleased to return home and discover Hayes with the villain! Later, Sheila pushed Jack to tell Finn the truth, but he resisted out of concern for the consequences.</p><p>Li was shocked to hear that he had an affair with Sheila and had been lying to her and Finn about it ever since, but he bit the bullet and first told her the awful truth. She was obviously incensed, and she made Jack tell Finn the truth before he heard it from someone else.</p><p>When Jack told his son the truth, Finn threw him out of the house, and Jack vanished, probably waiting for the situation to calm down.</p><p>If you are interested to know about the stars of other series, read below posts:</p><p>You can bookmark our website <a href=# rel=noopener>venturejolt.com</a> and read our most recent blogs for more information about other actors, characters and other topics.
