But it was when Gosling screamed, “Her milkshake brings this boy to the yard!” that everyone lost it — director Greta Gerwig laughed uncontrollably, and Robbie couldn’t help but break character. The one person who didn’t react hysterically was Gosling himself, who continued to improvise as Ken, going on to call Barbie “my divine girl.”</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken in ‘Barbie.’Jaap Buitendijk</p></figure><p>Some viewers thought “sublime!” was a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>nod to the band</a>, but like his quotes in the bloopers, Gosling also improvised that line — it just happened to be the take that made the final cut. In fact, the Oscar nominee improvised during several of his scenes in Barbie. In a July interview with the Associated Press, Robbie said <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Gosling was behind</a> some of the film’s most hilarious Ken moments.</p><p>“There were a lot of things that Ryan did that were spur of the moment, like he just did that on that take, like putting on the sunglasses twice — I didn’t know he was going to do that,” she said. “There was this one scene where he was throwing all of Barbie’s clothes off the balcony and having a full meltdown. And they were such tricky Barbie names to say [...] Honestly, we were crying. I’m not exaggerating.”</p><p>Robbie added, “To credit to Ryan, he made people cry with laughter multiple, multiple times in this film.” Many fans had the same reaction, and some have even called that “sublime!” line one of <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the funniest parts of the movie</a>.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZquxkaN6qLvSpaCnn12owqO4yKacZpqcpLyxsdGsZJuZope2pnnVoqmapF2ptqzAzqRkpJ2e</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./russell-brand-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Russell Brand Net Worth 2024</span></a>
