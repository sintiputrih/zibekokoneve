Before I started the line, I had gotten a pair of Tom Ford frames before I got pregnant with Apollo, but it was more work to put them on. But now I get so excited for the opticals. Sunglasses are just icing on the cake!”</span></p><p class=p1><strong><span class=s1>On what she likes about making frames:</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“What’s so cool with this line is that people are buying it because they look good on them. It kind of has to be that way. People go with what they feel comfortable in. Glasses are cool because they’re so inclusive of so many people. It’s so exciting when I go to Instagram or Twitter and I see people showing off the new collection. People are just wearing them because they like them. It’s such a huge jolt.&nbsp;The new collection just came to my house, and I’m having so much fun. One of my favorite pairs is a gray pair called Lenka [shown below], but there are so many good ones.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lamb-8x10-counter-card-la046_gry_6417.jpg alt="Gwen Sefani" width=1000 height=1251 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=p1><strong><span class=s1>On how she makes it a family affair:</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“My middle son, Zuma, he has to wear glasses all the time. When I first heard —&nbsp;you feel bad. You don’t want ever want anything hard for your kids. But then he ended up being part of my inspiration. It helped shift the focus from sunglasses to optical, and I didn’t expect that.“</span></p><p class=p1><strong><span class=s1>On how her career, life, and romance changes in recent years have changed her style:</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“My style has for sure been impacted. I wasn’t one to wear a lot of girlie things but now I’m going for more feminine things. It’s really weird, I’ve always been an emotional dresser my whole life. I just would want to go with how I’m feeling or what I feel like about my body and that would dictate my style. So now I’m feeling more feminine.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lamb-la539-rgd-18x24-poster-6418.jpg alt="Gwen Sefani" width=1000 height=1333 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=p1><strong><span class=s1>On pairing bright frames with bright lipstick:</span></strong></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I’m the no-rules queen.
