They all involve listening to a Pokémon's <a href=# title=Cry>cry</a> then immediately using the Coin Case. Due to a translation bug, the Coin Case text is improperly terminated, making the game jump to $E112 every time it is used. This section of RAM is used by the game to store data related to Pokémon cries. Depending on the Pokémon's cry listened to, one of several effects will be activated: the game may restart with an altered color scheme and possibly blocks of color placed on the screen ("Glitch Dimension", "Shadow Puppet Effect" and "Shadow Puppets"), the game may crash to a white screen, or "Coin Case:" and a glitch phrase may be displayed (e.g., "which move?PP of"). The most well known of these glitches can be performed in Pokémon Gold using the <a href=# title="Machop (Pokémon)">Machop</a> in <a href=# title="Vermilion City">Vermilion City</a>.</p><h2><span id=Glitches_caused_by_each_Pok.C3.A9mon_cry></span><span class=mw-headline id=Glitches_caused_by_each_Pokémon_cry>Glitches caused by each Pokémon cry</span></h2>Info<ul><li>An asterisk by an effect means that the text is displayed in a dialogue box one line under "Coins:".</li><li>"†" (a dagger)in addition to an asterisk by an effect means that the text goes over the edge of the dialogue box.</li><li>"‡" (double daggers) by an effect means that a special version of the "Glitch Dimension" is started, dubbed "Shadow Puppets" or called the "Shadow Puppet Effect".</li></ul><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Display_alterations>Display alterations</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Glitch_dimension>Glitch dimension</span></h3><i>Main article: <a href=# title="Glitch dimension">Glitch dimension</a></i><p>When accessed, the game restarts in what appears as an altered color scheme. This is particularly evident in the beginning cutscene/intro movie. The entire (apparently) game can be played as normal. When the player talks to a character, gets on his bike, goes through a door/portal, opens the menu, or does any other action affecting his sprite (though not necessarily changing it), a purple block is generated depending on the position of the player. At other times, seemingly randomly, blocks of color will be generated. For example, after flying to Cinnabar Island and Surfing downwards, the water will be blue, red and green in different places. Battles will be conducted with the colors of the HP bar, names, Pokémon, and Trainers altered, and with blocks of purple. Interestingly, the blocks seem to slide across the screen as the battle begins (at the point where the stat areas and Trainer slide into view). In towns, houses, routes, and other locations, blocks of color can be made to disappear by moving so that they move off-screen. The blocks appear to not be just a display problem, because they scroll with the map. This is apparently caused by the game thinking that it is being played on a Classic <a href=# title="Game Boy">Game Boy</a>.</p><p>When a <a href=# title=Cheating>cheating device</a> is used to walk through objects, in some cases where the game does not <a href=# title="Game freeze">freeze</a> when the player walks out of the <span class=explain title="When you walk past formatted boundaries, such as into the black space inside a house.">game</span>, the game will restart in a "clean" glitch dimension where the background of the title screen is gray and has no blocky effects. Gameplay will be virtually the same, the only difference being; when a person is talked to, glitch dimension blocks will appear.</p><p>When the game is restarted, the color scheme is forced to use the player's palette on the title sequence. This makes it appear to display <a href=# title="Ho-Oh (Pokémon)">Ho-Oh</a> in color, due to the similarities in the palette and where the colors are assigned. <a href=# title="Lugia (Pokémon)">Lugia</a>'s sprite is assigned only two colors in Silver and will not display in color.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/c/c2/Glitch_dimension_Ho-Oh.png decoding=async width=160 height=144 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Ho-Oh in a "clean" Glitch Dimension.<h4><span class=mw-headline id=Video>Video</span></h4><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1.2><tr><td></td></tr><tr readability=2.8695652173913><td width=425px colspan=2><b>This video is not available on Bulbapedia; instead, you can watch the video on YouTube <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>here</a>.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1.3269230769231><tr><td></td></tr><tr readability=2.8695652173913><td width=425px colspan=2><b>This video is not available on Bulbapedia; instead, you can watch the video on YouTube <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>here</a>.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Shadow_Theater>Shadow Theater</span></h3><p>Everything is completely white, except for the sprites (such as the player character, the NPCs, the Game Freak logo at the beginning). The sprites are either black, extremely darkened, dark blue, or near white. Sometimes an already-dark sprite will become white. Sprites with areas of high contrast (near black near white combinations) will appear partially black and partially white. Menus are not visible, but it is possible to navigate through them by memory. When viewing the PokéGear only the arrow selector pointing upwards is visible in the upper-left corner. During battles, the images of the Pokémon are not visible, but the blacked-out move graphics are. The specific cause of this is unknown, but is probably related to the cause of the Glitch Dimension.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Video_2>Video</span></h4><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1.2777777777778><tr><td></td></tr><tr readability=2.8695652173913><td width=425px colspan=2><b>This video is not available on Bulbapedia; instead, you can watch the video on YouTube <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>here</a>.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Changes_in_the_beginning_cutscene>Changes in the beginning cutscene</span></h3><table><tbody readability=3><tr readability=6><td><table border=1 width=100% class=sortable><tbody readability=7.5><tr><th>Object(s)</th><th>Original color</th><th>Color in <i>Glitch Dimension</i></th><th>Color in <i>Shadow Theater</i></th></tr><tr><td>Game Freak logo</td><td>Yellow</td><td>White</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Shellder</td><td>Blue-white with red tongue</td><td>Pink with blue tongue</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Lapras</td><td>Blue with blue-white shell</td><td>Pink-Red with light pink shell</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Magikarp</td><td>Red</td><td>Blue</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Pikachu</td><td>Yellow, red cheek pouches</td><td>Same as normal color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Jigglypuff</td><td>Purple</td><td>Same as normal color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Totodile</td><td>Light blue</td><td>Pink</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Chikorita</td><td>Green</td><td>Light orange</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Cyndaquil</td><td>Orange and black with red flames</td><td>Same as normal color</td><td>Black with white detail</td></tr><tr><td>Charizard</td><td>Red</td><td>Blue</td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td><i>Gold Version</i></td><td>Gold</td><td>Silver</td><td>Invisible</td></tr><tr><td>Ho-Oh silhouette</td><td>Black</td><td>Red with pink wing tips</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Sparkles from silhouette</td><td>Yellow</td><td>Purple</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><i>Silver Version</i></td><td>Silver</td><td>Blue-grey with white highlight</td><td>Invisible</td></tr><tr><td>Lugia silhouette</td><td>Black</td><td>Black</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Clouds from silhouette</td><td>Grey</td><td>Black</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>"Pokémon" logo</td><td>Yellow with blue border</td><td>Dark yellow with blue border and green shadow</td><td>Invisible/White</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Arbitrary_code_execution>Arbitrary code execution</span></h2><i>See also: <a href=# title="Arbitrary code execution">Arbitrary code execution</a></i><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Perfect_EVs>Perfect EVs</span></h3><p>When the game jumps to $E112, it starts executing data related to <a href=# title=Pokémon>Pokémon</a> cries as machine instructions. In particular, when <a href=# title="Coin Case">Coin Case</a> is used after hearing the <a href=# title="Machop (Pokémon)">Machop</a> cry, the game will eventually reach address $E912. Data around that address is related to the overworld and can be manipulated through moving around in different patterns. When exiting Professor Elm's Laboratory and moving four steps to the right (prior to using the Coin Case after hearing the Machop's cry), the game will jump to address $FA98, which is in the middle of the data of the third Pokémon in the player's party. The game can therefore be made to execute specific code, based on the Pokémon's attributes such as species, item held, ..., by deliberately placing party Pokémon. By placing a specific species of Pokémon in the fourth slot of the party with the correct held item and first move, the game's execution may even be made to jump to the memory area that stores the items deposited in the player's PC, where code will execute based on the identifier and quantity of the items in the PC.</p><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1.2660550458716><tr><td></td></tr><tr readability=2.8695652173913><td width=425px colspan=2><b>This video is not available on Bulbapedia; instead, you can watch the video on YouTube <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>here</a>.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=roundy><tbody readability=1.3269230769231><tr><td></td></tr><tr readability=2.8695652173913><td width=425px colspan=2><b>This video is not available on Bulbapedia; instead, you can watch the video on YouTube <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>here</a>.</b></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_modifying_using_box_names></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_modifying_using_box_names>Pokémon modifying using box names</span></h3><p>By meeting special conditions, the player can allow the Coin Case to execute arbitrary code based on the names of their PC boxes, which in turn can modify the first Pokémon in the player's party. The exploit requires having a freshly caught low-level "slide" Pokémon with specific DVs in the party's third slot (preferably caught from Route 29), and a Quagsire holding TM02 with Return as its first move. Finally by performing a specific movement pattern, the player can listen to a certain Pokémon's cry (e.g. Machop or Bellsprout), then use the Coin Case to execute code from the box names.</p><p>The "slide Pokémon" is what allows the game to read the Quagsire and its first move and held item, which in turn uses it as a jump location to execute arbritrary code (because Quagsire's index number C3 represents the instruction jp yyxx), in this case the location it goes to is the PC box names. It is important to have a "good" slide Pokémon as bad opcodes such as FF (rst $38) causes the game to not reach the Quagsire's data, and is unable to execute the box names as code. Without a "good" slide Pokémon, the game will freeze or trigger Glitch Dimension upon using the Coin Case even after the other requirements are met. Obtaining a working slide Pokémon can be very time consuming and luck dependant, as a result this is one of the most common reasons the glitch fails. The best solution if the glitch fails is to catch another Pokémon, and repeat if it doesn't work. Once a "good" slide Pokémon is caught, it will always work.[<i>citation needed</i>]</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Requirements>Requirements</span></h4><ul><li>Slot 1: Pokémon that the player wants changed</li></ul><ul><li>Slot 2: Any Pokémon</li></ul><ul><li>Slot 3: A low-leveled freshly caught "slide Pokémon"</li></ul><p>The player must also have <a href=# title="Bellsprout (Pokémon)">Bellsprout</a> registered in the Pokédex to listen to its cry.</p><p>How to perform:</p><ul><li>Leave the Poké Mart and take 4 steps to the right</li></ul><ul><li>Switch pockets (required) and use the Coin Case</li></ul><ul><li>If performed correctly, the menus will slow down and the sprites will disappear.
