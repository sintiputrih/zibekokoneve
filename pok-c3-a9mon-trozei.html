In European versions, it is known as <b>Pokémon Link!</b>.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Gameplay>Gameplay</span></h2><p>Pokémon Trozei! is a variation of <a href=# class=extiw title="smw:Yoshi's Cookie">Yoshi's Cookie</a>-style gameplay. The blocks are symbols shaped like various Pokémon. These blocks fall from the top screen down to the bottom screen (assuming that the bottom screen is not full, in which case they will stack up in the top screen). The symbols will disappear when four of the same symbol are in a row. Symbols can be swapped by moving a row or column up, down, left, or right with the stylus.</p><p>To get a Trozei, four of the same Pokémon must be lined up in a row. <a href=# title="Ditto (Pokémon)">Ditto</a> works as a 'wild card' Pokémon that can match up with anything and appears when five symbols are Trozeied at once. Trozeis can only be made on the bottom screen. If there is a match up on the top screen, the symbols must fall to the bottom screen before the Trozei will go off. Once the group of four has been matched up (either horizontally or vertically), they will leave the screen. The bottom screen's background will then turn green and allow a Trozei Chance (or Link Chance in Europe), when there is a short amount of time where three Pokémon can be matched. This continues again with a pair of matched Pokémon, and also allows new combinations like L and T shapes, or even huge chunks of Pokémon to be Trozeied simultaneously. This lasts for as long as matches can be pulled together, though the time limit on the Trozei Chance gets smaller and smaller as the game continues.</p><p>If every Pokémon on screen happens to get Trozeied, a 10,000 point bonus Trozei All will be attained.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Plot>Plot</span></h2><a href=# class=image title=201><img alt=201 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/c/c4/Ani201ODEX.png decoding=async width=32 height=32 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=# class=image title=201><img alt=201 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/c/c4/Ani201ODEX.png decoding=async width=32 height=32 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>The story of Pokémon Trozei is based on the adventures of <a href=# title="Lucy Fleetfoot">Lucy Fleetfoot</a>.

This is a Boss Battle. General Buzz drops Jammer Balls into spaces where Pokémon should be. He can also make "Trozei Left" all the way up to 50 if it is below 10 and he is not stunned.

Beating Trozei Hard Adventure will unlock Forever Mode, which has a bigger grid and requires five matched Pokémon to make a Trozei. The time for a Trozei chance is also greatly reduced.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Endless_Mode>Endless Mode</span></h3><p>As the name suggests, this mode continues until the play area is completely filled with pieces where the goal is to get the highest score. Whenever a player starts this mode, they have the option to choose a level. If the player chooses a higher level, they will receive a large sum of bonus points. The higher the level, more Pokémon will appear, and higher bonuses will be attained. Also, certain Pokémon can only be obtained here, although these can also be found in Pair Trozei, Forever Mode, and Mr. Who's. It is divided into many levels. The player can start on any level which is a multiple of 5 that they have cleared already, and before reaching level 25, they can start from 1, 5, 10, 15 or 20. The maximum level is greater than 145. The player completes a level when they clear the necessary amount of Pokémon. When the level changes, the common and the rare Pokémon also change. Soon after the level has changed, Pokémon which appear are a little, and as the player gets Trozei more and more, Pokémon will appear faster.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Forever_Mode>Forever Mode</span></h3><p>Forever Mode is unlocked when the Phobosphere is beaten on hard mode. In this mode, the grid in which Pokémon are Trozeid is 5 squares by 7 squares. In order to do a basic Trozei, 5 Pokémon must be lined up instead of the usual 4, and in order to continue the Trozei chance, 4 Pokémon must be Trozeid, and then 3, before being able to Trozei 2 Pokémon. Trozeies also occur twice as quickly.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Battle_Mode>Battle Mode</span></h3><p>Two players can compete against one another over the DS's Wireless Connection. When one player makes a Trozei, the Pokémon Trozeid will drop onto the opponent's field.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Pair_Mode>Pair Mode</span></h3><p>Two players can cooperate via the DS's Wireless Connection in an attempt to beat the high score.</p><h3><span id=Agent_Caf.C3.A9></span><span class=mw-headline id=Agent_Café>Agent Café</span></h3><p>The <a href=# title="Agent Café">Agent Café</a> houses the Agent Card collection, the player's personal Agent Card, and Espionage mode. Agent Cards are saved in the Agent Café's collection whenever two owners of Trozei! communicate and play together. The player's Agent Card can be personalized with gender, name, birthdate, and phrase. The player may also access a Phobos Battalion storage with a special rare Pokémon from their Agent Card; the Pokémon is randomly assigned to each player of Trozei!.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Espionage>Espionage</span></h4><p>Espionage mode is the way two players of Trozei! may communicate. Espionage mode allows players to link for Pair or Battle modes.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=PictoChat_Search>PictoChat Search</span></h4><p>PictoChat Search is a feature that allows the player to use wireless communication to search for friends using PictoChat nearby, this feature is not in the Japanese version of Pokémon Trozei. The PictoChat Search in the USA version of the game is located in options right before adventure reset.</p><h2><span id=Pok.C3.A9dex></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokédex>Pokédex</span></h2><p>Pokémon Trozei! has a side mission of completing the National Pokédex. To get a Pokémon's entry, the player must do a combination with their symbol in Adventure Mode, and then send them back to Professor P.</p><p><a href=# title="Legendary Pokémon">Legendary Pokémon</a> are very rare, but there is a way to make finding them easier. By using Espionage Mode, it is possible to link up with a player who has seen a Pokémon missing from the first player's Pokédex. Professor P will then say that the Phobos Battalion has the Pokémon in the same place that the second player found it, and the Pokémon can now be found. Each player is assigned a rare Pokémon on their Agent Card. However, this cannot be changed, making it extremely difficult to find legendary Pokémon. This mode however, is deactivated once the console reaches a low battery level.</p><p>Another way to find rare Pokémon is to challenge <a href=# title="Mr. Who">Mr. Who</a>, a collector who collects Poké Balls that fall out of the Phobos Battalion's planes. For prize coins, the player can challenge him. The main difference is that there are seven columns rather than five, allowing for more possible combinations. Some Pokémon can only be found with Mr. Who.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Reception>Reception</span></h2><p>Gaming magazine <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:Famitsu>Famitsu</a> gave Pokémon Trozei! a score of 31 out of 40.<a href=#>[3]</a> <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:IGN>IGN</a> rated the game a "Great" 8.0/10.<a href=#>[4]</a> It holds a rating of 72.62% on <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:GameRankings>GameRankings</a>, based on 29 reviews.<a href=#>[5]</a></p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Sales>Sales</span></h3><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Japanese_sales>Japanese sales</span></h4><p>Pokémon Trozei! sold 66,248 units on its first week on the Japanese market, with a <a href=# class=extiw title=wp:sell-through>sell-through</a> of 59.60%.
