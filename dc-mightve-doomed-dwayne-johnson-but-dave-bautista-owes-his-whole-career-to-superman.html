But while The Rock’s reputation has taken a considerable hit, with Johnson now spending his time hanging out in woods and ruminating on the nature of failure in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">strange Instagram videos</a>, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dave Bautista</a></strong> owes his entire post-WWE career to DC.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=539 data-current-count=539 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">As previously uncovered</a>, Johnson might’ve failed to make his dream of battling Superman on screen a reality, but Bautista already managed to do just that almost 20 years ago. Back in 2006, the Guardians of the Galaxy star made a guest appearance on Smalville to fight with Tom Welling’s Clark Kent as a Kryptonian criminal escaped from the Phantom Zone. It just so happens that this TV role marked Bautista’s very first acting assignment, and it sounds like he can credit it for awakening his interest in the profession.</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>“[The] Smallville gig was another one of those things I got through WWE,” Bautista <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">is known to have stated</a>. “At that point, I had absolutely no aspirations to pursue acting.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dave-bautista-smallville-henry-cavill-superman.jpg><p data-characters=725 data-current-count=725 data-injectable=false>While his turn as Aldar in Smallville was hardly a taxing acting debut for Bautista, mostly relying on his physicality, clearly it sowed the seeds for further ambitions to conquer Hollywood just as he had done the wrestling world. These days, Bautista is confident enough in his performing abilities to throw shade at Dwayne Johnson by saying <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he doesn’t want to be “the next Rock”</a> as he’d rather be known as a “respected” and “good” actor. That’s quite the change from once being a guy with zero interest in the profession. And fans of his turns in the likes of Glass Onion, Blade Runner 2049, and countless others have Smallville and the worlds of DC to thank for that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylr4ymoKCgpKuybrDOqKSenF2ZxKLFzZ5ko6eYo8CwuoybrK1llJbDpnnBmqytoaOprm671p6qZqCZqHq4tM6lnGabkaeypr6MraZmq6WlsrO5wKdm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-beckham-lightsaber-graham-norton-show.html><span>←</span><span>Watch David Beckham Be Challenged to a Lightsaber Duel</span></a>
