The couple are the parents of daughter Annabelle, 7, and 5-year-old twin boys, Luke and Keller. Emily is also the stepmother to Shane’s daughters from his first marriage, Shelby and Chanel.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Emily celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary in February 2019 with a sweet tribute to her husband.</p><p>“Even after a decade together ….we are still committed to each other, and committed to raising five kids (3 together and my two step-daughters) with heaps of love and laughter and the very best of parenting intentions to guide them to become kind, compassionate, inspiring and educated humans,” the Bravo star wrote via Instagram at the time. “Thank you Mr. Simpson for always putting me and our family first after all these years together. Your integrity, commitment to family and hands on approach to parenting our children is always to be commended!! Here’s to another 10 years!”</p><p>Emily has also documented her marriage struggles on RHOC. The reality star told Us Weekly in October 2019 that she and her husband weren’t in the ” best place in our marriage” while filming season 14. However, Emily noted that the duo “are really good [now],” following their challenging period.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jxm65wpyYq6yYrnq1sculqmaqmKSwtHnEpqClsV2otq680qilZqCVp3qpwdKbmKecXZ7Abq2MpaasnaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dustin-lance-black-net-worth-income-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dustin Lance Black Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
