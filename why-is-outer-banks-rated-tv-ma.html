And if you thought this North Carolina drama was insane last year, buckle up. There’s even more secret maps, more giant action sequences, and more crackling chemistry between teen heartthrobs, John B (<a href=#>Chase Stokes</a>) and Sarah Cameron (<a href=#>Madelyn Cline</a>).</p><p>Outer Banks revolves around the life of John B, a member of a group of friends known as the Pogues. They’re not blinded by money and manners like the Kooks. They’re just some adventurous, deeply loyal kids who love boating and swimming. But when the Pogues track down the treasure that cost John B’s father his life, their world will forever change.</p><p>Though there are mainly teens in the cast, is Outer Banks&nbsp;for kids? We can help guide parents to the right direction — here’s why&nbsp;Outer Banks got its rating:</p><h2>What is&nbsp;Outer Banks rated? Is Outer Banks for kids?</h2><p>Outer Banks is rated TV-MA, which means it’s not really for kids. While there isn’t much sexuality in the series (aside from some kissing and non-graphic sexual exploration), the series earned its TV-MA rating for strong language and intense violence. Murder is littered throughout the series, people!</p><h2>Why is&nbsp;Outer Banks rated TV-MA?</h2><p>Outer Banks most likely earned its TV-MA rating for violence and drug use, as well as profanity and some sexual content. The teens in the series are on the run from people trying to kill them — after all. The show frequently uses profanity. Though Outer Banks may feel like a harmless teen drama on the surface, it’s way less kid-friendly than one might think.</p><p>Many of the characters are consistently high on drugs and are often unsupervised, participating in adult activities. Death, underage drinking, loss of family, betrayal, and murder are all mature topics in Outer Banks. There is also partial nudity and implication of teen sex, kissing, flirting, etc.</p><h2>Is there a trailer for the Outer Banks?</h2><p>You bet.
