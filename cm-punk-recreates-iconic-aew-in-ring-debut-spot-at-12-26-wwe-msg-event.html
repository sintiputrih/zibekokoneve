At a particular moment of the match, Mysterio climbed the turnbuckle and tried to land a move on Punk. However, Punk sat up and made Mysterio miss the spot while Punk laughed, recreating a spot from Punk’s bout with Darby Allin at AEW All Out 2021.</p><p>The Second City Saint ultimately put down Dominik Mysterio with a vicious GTS for the win. <a href=#>The Madison Square Garden house show achieved record-breaking success</a> for WWE, making it a monumental event in every aspect.
