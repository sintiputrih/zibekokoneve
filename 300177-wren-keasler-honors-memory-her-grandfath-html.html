Although she lives a private life, some details about Wren are known to the public through her mom, Shannon Lee.</p><p class=dh>It has been years since Bruce Lee's passing, but his legacy lives on through his bloodline – the mixed martial artist's only daughter, Shannon Lee, and her daughter, Wren Keasler.</p><p class=dh>Wren definitely knows her roots and is proud to be the granddaughter of a legendary man. Two years ago, Wren collaborated with her mom to create a special tribute to Bruce ahead of his 80th birthday.</p><p class=dh>Wren's mother is undoubtedly proud of the daughter she has, who she described as "amazing" in the video. The duo has a close bond and sometimes explores the outdoors, as seen in an Instagram <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CgFS_-AMFWC/?hl=en">photo</a> of their mountain adventure together in Cape Town.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Wren Is Aware of Her Roots</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Born on December 14, 2002, as Wren Lee Keasler, Bruce Lee's granddaughter carries both her father's and mother's family names. Wren undoubtedly takes pride in being a Lee, thanks to her grandfather's legacy.</p><p class=dh>She is also involved in the Bruce Lee Foundation, which her mother runs. Wren showed her support when the organization launched its Youth Mental Wellness Now project and even shared the stage with her mom.</p><p class=dh>During the event, Wren rubbed elbows with hundreds of youth leaders and community activists to talk about mental health and the pressing concern to address it amongst today's generation. Although still young, Wren has already been exposed to humanitarian efforts.</p><p class=dh>In 2022, Wren reached a milestone as she celebrated her 20th birthday. Her mom paid tribute to her with a special Instagram post featuring a throwback photo of the celebrant alongside a recent picture. In a different birthday post, Shannon <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIwXBP-gIt-/?hl=en&nbsp;- said">said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"I am honored to be your mother, Wren! You bring light and love with you everywhere you go! Thank you for blessing my life."</p><p class=dh>While Shannon's Instagram account is open to the public, Wren's social media platform is private. As of writing, she has less than 30 posts with a little over 1,000 followers composed of her family and friends.</p><p class=dh>Her mother previously clarified that Wren only had one account in case the public accessed a page with her name. According to Shannon, such social media accounts might be fake. However, fans can get a glimpse of Wren's social media presence through Bruce Lee's Snapchat account, which she runs.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Wren's Mother Didn't Take Her Husband's Surname</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Wren is the daughter of Shannon with her husband, Ian Keasler. The couple has been together for over two decades, continuously working to protect their marriage. "Marriage is definitely a different step on the relationship road," Shannon <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=t88DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA67&dq=shannon+lee&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgjLyX4s78AhVBgosKHd6NBHUQ6AF6BAhdEAI#v=onepage&q=shannon%20lee&f=false&nbsp;">said</a>.</p><p class=dh>In what was a beautiful ceremony, Wren's parents tied the knot in 1994 in Palos Verdes Estates, California. However, Wren's mom did not take her husband's last name and instead retained Lee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ce3903cf65a7fdd3b4cb67adc2573afd.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Bruce Lee poses for a portrait, circa 1972. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>During the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/archive/fighting-spirit-vol-44-no-17/>ceremony</a>, Wren's grandmother, Linda, walked Shannon down the aisle as Bruce Lee had already passed away. The beloved actor's <a class="me a" href=#>death</a> on July 20, 1973, came as a surprise to many as he always seemed healthy and worked hard to keep his body fit.</p><p class=dh>He was discovered lifeless in Hong Kong after consuming a prescription painkiller, to which he had a hypersensitive reaction. Bruce was most recognized for his roles in titles like "The Big Boss," "Fist of Fury," and "Enter the Dragon."</p><p class=dh>An actor similar to him was <a class="me a" href=#>Steve McQueen</a>, who starred in "The Getaway" and "Papillon." Although the actors were initially on good terms, they reportedly became rivals as time passed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmxnaWlnbHq4vsSnZKSdkai5pr6Moaanp6Koeq6xzKipsmWYmr9us9GapZ2ekam1b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-next-for-the-brooklyn-99-cast-now-that-the-sitcom-is-over.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Next For The 'Brooklyn 99' Cast Now That The Sitcom Is Over?</span></a>
