That being said, Giulia won’t immediately end up in WWE.</p><p><a href=#>It was previously noted</a> that WWE has interest in bringing Giulia to the company. That may be a possibility, and she could even make a trip to the WWE Performance Center soon to check out the operation first-hand.</p><p>Dave Meltzer noted on <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a> that Giulia may be on her way to WWE, but it won’t be possible for a few months.</p><p>“So this is the Giulia story. She’s under contract until March. So up until March, nothing’s happening.</p><p>“Mike Johnson was correct in reporting that there’s interest, but there’s been interest in her since 2019. It is a story now because there’s more interest in her now, but she’s not going anywhere until March.</p><p>“The part about her going to the Performance Center, I’ve had people deny that. We’ll find out, but I was told that her schedule is booked for the rest of the year. She is coming to the United States in January for the show in San Jose, but she’s under contract and, unless Bushiroad gives the okay and I don’t know why they would, she wouldn’t really be allowed to do a WWE tryout right now.</p><p>“I asked at WWE and they also told me the same thing, they told me that was not happening but they’re very interested in her.</p><p>“Nothing’s a given that she’s going. She ain’t going anywhere until March, and she does have a verbal commitment afterwards. But it’s only a verbal commitment. And that’s for Japan, so we’ll have to see.</p><p>“The idea that like, ‘Oh my god, she’s going to WWE’, it’s so premature to say that. But, could it happen in March? Absolutely it could happen in March, yes.”</p><p>WWE has a lot of plans for the future, and Giulia just may fit into those. Only time will tell what Giulia does next in her career, because it was also rumored that she is lined up to face Mercedes Mone in Japan.</p><p>Giulia has a ton of potential, but she may need to tone down her move set a bit if she goes to WWE. The company doesn’t like to be as stiff as Giulia is known for in her matches, but that is just another obstacle to hurdle over.</p><p>What’s your take on Giulia ending up in WWE?
