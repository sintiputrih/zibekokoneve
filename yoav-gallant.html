Before diving into politics, Gallant was a top commander in the Israel Defense Forces, leading the Southern Command.</p><p>In January 2015, he made a switch to politics by joining the Kulanu party, and later he became the Minister of Construction after being elected to the Knesset.</p><p>In 2018, he switched to Likud and held significant roles like Minister of Aliyah and Integration, and Minister of Education. Right now, Gallant is in the news because of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas.</p><p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas, a group from Palestine, carried out a terrible attack on Israel, causing a lot of loss of life and capturing over 150 innocent people.</p><p>In response, Israel fought back strongly by hitting Hamas camps in Gaza with a lot of rockets. Iran, a big supporter of Hamas and the main force behind the attack warned Israel that it would face serious consequences if it tried to go into Gaza with ground forces.</p><p>Each day brings new developments in this war, and it’s worrying that it could escalate into a much bigger conflict involving the whole world.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title="Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Israeli-Defense-Minister-Yoav-Gallant.webp alt="Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant" width=400 height=487 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Gallant’s Role in the Israel-Hamas War</strong></h2><p>On October 9, 2023, during the conflict between Gaza and Israel, Gallant, an important figure, said something very important. He said Israel was going to stop everything from going in or out of the Gaza Strip, like electricity, food, water, and fuel.</p><p>He was very serious about this and said it was because of how the other side was acting without any humanity. Then, on October 13, 2023, Gallant met with a person from the United States called Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.</p><p>In this meeting, Gallant told the people in northern Gaza, which included Gaza City, to leave and go to the south to stay safe. He wanted to separate the regular people from the ones causing harm.</p><p>He also said they planned to destroy places where the group Hamas, which was causing trouble, worked from or stayed, in Gaza and even beyond.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Yoav Gallant " src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yoav-Gallant-wikipedia.webp alt="Yoav Gallant wikipedia" width=400 height=352 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2><strong>Yoav Served in the Military</strong></h2><p>In 1977, Yoav Gallant joined the navy as a commando in Shayetet 13. In the 1980s, after six years, he briefly worked as a lumberjack in Alaska before returning to the Navy.</p><p>Later, in 1992, he was chosen to lead Shayetet 13, a role scheduled for 1994. However, Gallant opted not to pursue more studies, moving to ground forces in 1993, leading the Menashe Territorial Brigade.</p><p>After leading Shayetet 13 and the Gaza Division, Gallant took on significant roles, including Chief of Staff of the GOC Army Headquarters.</p><p>In 2005, he led the Southern Command during Operation Cast Lead against Hamas. Despite some controversies, Gallant’s role in the operation earned him praise, enhancing his path to becoming chief of staff.</p><p>Yet, challenges arose as Yesh Gvul opposed his appointment as IDF chief of staff, expressing concerns about potential violations of international law. Haaretz highlighted Gallant’s disagreement over investigating an airstrike during Cast Lead.</p><p>Despite differences in opinion, an investigation was initiated, highlighted by the Goldstone Report, later disavowed by its author, raising concerns about a potential breach of international law.</p><p>Read Also: <a href=# rel=noopener>Inna Vernikov Wiki, Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Net Worth, Parents and More</a></p><p><img decoding=async title="Yoav Gallant with Benjamin Netanyahu" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yoav-Gallant-with-Benjamin-Netanyahu.webp alt="Yoav Gallant with Benjamin Netanyahu" width=400 height=404 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Career In Politics</strong></h2><p>In January 2015, Gallant joined Kulanu, a new political party led by Moshe Kahlon.

He left the Knesset on January 2, 2019. In the Thirty-fifth Israeli government, Gallant served as the Minister of Education.</p><p>On January 17, 2021, he enacted a rule barring organizations opposing Israel’s democratic, Jewish, and Zionist values from entering schools, specifically those calling Israel an “apartheid state.”</p><p>In 2021, as the Minister of Education, he opposed awarding the Israel Prize in math to Professor Oded Goldreich, citing Goldreich’s stance against labeling the BDS movement as anti-Semitic. Israel’s Supreme Court upheld Gallant’s objection.</p><p>On March 25, 2023, Gallant supported protests against the government’s judicial system changes, requesting talks between the ruling coalition and the opposition. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir sought Gallant’s dismissal.</p><p>Though initially announced, Gallant’s office stated no official dismissal notice was received. Eventually, on April 10, Netanyahu confirmed Gallant would retain his position.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Yoav Gallant mother Fruma Gallant" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Yoav-Gallant-mother-Fruma-Gallant.webp alt="Yoav Gallant mother Fruma Gallant" width=400 height=550 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2><strong>Gallant’s Mom was a Holocaust Survivor&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>On November 8, 1958, Yoav Gallant (age 64) was in Jaffa to Polish Jewish immigrants.
