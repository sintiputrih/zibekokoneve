He was part of an expedition organized by Asian Trekking, led by Dawa Steven Sherpa. According to Sherpa, Kennison began displaying abnormal behavior from the south summit.</p><p>In an effort to assist Jason Kennison, the two Sherpa guides accompanying him helped him descend to the balcony area, situated at 8,400 meters above sea level. However, when Kennison refused to move further, the guides had to proceed to camp four as their oxygen cylinders were running out. They planned to return with fresh oxygen cylinders to rescue him, but unfavorable weather conditions and strong winds prevented their immediate return.</p><p>Jason Kennison’s remarkable climb came 17 years after he was informed that he might never walk again following a car accident in 2006 that resulted in spinal cord injuries and battles with depression. He undertook the Everest ascent as a means to raise funds for Spinal Cord Injuries Australia.</p><p>Prior to embarking on the Everest expedition, Jason Kennison underwent rigorous training, including mountaineering courses in New Zealand, practicing abseiling and rock climbing, and setting up training facilities in his backyard for ladder crossing, jumaring, and roping.</p><p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is providing consular assistance to the Australian family affected by the tragic loss in Nepal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Jason Kennison’s Parents?</h2><p>His mother is known as Gill Kennison, and aside from her name, little is known about her. There are no details about his father as well.</p><p>Before his death on Friday, May 19, his mother spoke to him on Thursday, May 18. Speaking after the death of her son, she said;</p><p>“The last … FaceTime we had was on Wednesday and he spoke to … me in the garden and he showed us his tent, and he showed us his washing drying in his tent … and the view from his tent.</p><p>Then he rang me Thursday. He said, ‘Mum we’re doing the big walk to the summit at night’, and I couldn’t hear what he was saying, and he said, ‘I’ll see you when I get back’.</p><p>And I said, ‘Well just remember Jason please take it easy, take care and remember I’ll always, I’ll always love you’, and that was the last words we said.</p><p>Knowing they were my last words to him was comforting, I guess, in a way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfqGWRp7JutsCspqdlm5q7r7XSqKWsZaCWv6a606xm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kevin-dunn-wwe-wrestler-wiki-bio-age-height-why-people-hate-him.html><span>←</span><span>Kevin Dunn (WWE wrestler) Wiki Bio, age, height.
