It took a while for their mutual attraction to become evident, though.</p><p>Flash forward to 2010: Graham and Krause landed the roles of sister Sarah Braverman and brother Adam Braverman in the beloved NBC drama&nbsp;Parenthood.</p><p>“We couldn’t stop talking,” the actress told&nbsp;<a href=#>Good Housekeeping</a>&nbsp;in her January 2017 cover story of how their relationship evolved. “Not about ourselves, but about the world and books and family.”</p><p>Krause and Graham proved they were serious about each other early on in their courtship. “Once we got together, there was no game play[ing],” she explained. “It was like, ‘You like me, and I like you.’ It gave me an understanding of life: This is how things happen, and it’s completely random.”</p><p>Despite the pleasant outcome, the&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;alum was hesitant to jump into a relationship with her coworker. “At our age we’d probably both been through ‘showmances’ that went south and made work an uncomfortable place to be,” she wrote in her 2016 book,&nbsp;Talking as Fast as I Can: From Gilmore Girls to Gilmore Girls (and Everything in Between).</p><p>However, their cautious approach could not put out their spark. “Ultimately our mutual wariness gave way — it just sort of happened,” she recalled.</p><p>Now, the pair keep a relatively low profile, with the occasional cameo in one another’s projects and red carpet appearance to assure fans that their romance is still going strong.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s not a big, loud life,” Graham noted in&nbsp;Good Housekeeping. “We have a lot of neighbors, people come by, we’re with Peter’s son [Roman, whom he shares with ex <strong>Christine King</strong>] a lot and we keep it small.”</p><p>The twosome eventually added a rescue dog named Mochi to their family. “Today our dog went to her first puppy school class and she basically hid in a corner while the other puppies jumped all over one another like they were at a fun party,” Graham told <a href=#>The New York Times</a> in February 2020. “I choose to think this is a sign that she is deep and introspective and wise beyond her years.”</p><p>News broke in June 2022, however, that the twosome had secretly called it quits in 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuaLB0Z6lZp%2BilrWiuYyapZ1loJrBpr6MpKmaraOaerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIytoKadnJ67pnuRaWhvZWJigHl7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-tall-is-leo-woodall.html><span>←</span><span>How tall is Leo Woodall?</span></a>
