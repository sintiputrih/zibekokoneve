We'd turn him onto Chuck Berry and say, 'Look, it's all the same shit, man, and you can do it.'" Charlie Watts, a traditional jazz <a href=#>Drummer</a>, was also introduced to the blues through his association with the pair. "Keith and Brian turned me on to Jimmy Reed and people like that. I learned that Earl Phillips was playing on those records like a jazz <a href=#>Drummer</a>, playing swing, with a straight four." Jagger, recalling when he first heard the likes of Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters, Fats Domino, and other major <a href=#>American</a> R&B artists, said it "seemed the most real thing" he had heard up to that point. Similarly, Keith Richards, describing the first time he listened to Muddy Waters, said it was the "most powerful music [he had] ever heard&nbsp;... the most expressive." He also stated, "when you think of some dopey, spotty seventeen year old from Dartford, who wants to be Muddy Waters—and there were a lot of us—in a way, very pathetic, but in another way, very&nbsp;... heartwarming".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeipLmttc2gZKysn6OytHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5lGtpcXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-ellis-is-married-to-wife-katie-gilbert-kids.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Ellis is Married to Wife: Katie Gilbert.
