Instead, they seemingly turned on him, alongside many superstars on the current roster.</p><p>The Great One’s resurgence did not appeal to certain WWE superstars, believing that it could overshadow them on the road to WrestleMania 40. One of them evidently seen at the WrestleMania kick-off press event was current World champion, Seth Rollins.</p><p>However, WWE Hall of Famer Booker T believed that The Rock’s return should be a sight well-appreciated by the current roster members. He mentioned that it should be the benchmark they all should aspire to achieve in the future, considering the immense star power and influence of The People’s Champion.</p><p>Moreover, he even credited The Rock’s ability to generate revenue and bring eyeballs for the WWE product and the young guys should focus on becoming a major draw for the business. Booker T spoke about the same <a href=#>on his Hall of Fame podcast.</a></p><p>“I mean, there’s so many places to shoot from, and he just gets it back and, you know, goes with the flow and lets people dictate, you know, the way things are going to go. I’ve said it once. I’ve said it 1000 times there again; you gotta like The Rock coming back. Guys on the roster need to understand how to one day find themselves in that same spot. That seems like that will be the main goal as opposed to knocking, you know, knocking the game to play, you know, seriously not to play the game. And he’s figured the game out, man, and a young guy, you know, I understand finishing the story, too.”</p><p>“One thing that these younger guys on the roster, younger wrestlers, and the next generation need to understand is the revenue. The eyes, you know, that someone likes the right brain, it being a part of an event like that. It’s more than just wrestling. And there again, these young guys do this in the locker room, which has that next-level potential. They better be strategizing. They’re going to be thinking about, you know, what’s next.”</p><p>The Rock’s decision to battle his cousin, Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 40 was revoked by WWE CCO Triple H. The Game announced that Cody Rhodes, who won the 2024 Royal Rumble match will challenge The Tribal Chief for the Undisputed WWE Universal title.</p><p><a href=#>With Paul Heyman confirming that The Great One and The Head of the Table will be present on SmackDown next week</a> after hearing Triple H’s verdict, it would surely be a must-watched edition for the fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Are you excited to hear The Rock and Roman Reigns next week?
