Jenner and Marino's mother, Chrystie Scott, married in 1972, and during that time, they welcomed Burt Jenner and Marino, as noted by&nbsp;<a href=#>Insider</a>. However, while Scott was pregnant with Marino, she and Jenner decided to separate. The couple officially divorced in 1981, just a year after Jenner's first daughter was born. According to <a href=#>GH Gossip</a>, Jenner had left the family, and because of this, Marino and her older brother spent most of their time in Los Angeles, raised by their mother. Their already fractured relationship worsened when Jenner married Linda Thompson the same year her divorce from Scott was finalized. The Olympic athlete was focused on a new chapter in her life with a new family — one that didn't include Marino.</p><p>Marino stated that Jenner took a backseat as a father figure to her and Burt after remarrying. In an interview with ABC, she revealed, "We have a very complex relationship. He's disappeared from our lives, especially out of my life. So ... I'm looking forward to this next chapter." While Marino didn't provide many details regarding her and Jenner's relationship, it was evident that the athlete's absence had significantly impacted her. However, with Jenner's newfound happiness after transitioning, Marino had hoped the two could repair their broken relationship and make up for the lost time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamplaH1xgI6cmKKsnK67brbEp6Weql2kuaWx0q1knZmlnLW1sdFmmpqro5a7pb7AZqSaqpmjvG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-the-new-canceled-batgirl-film-leslie-grace.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To The New Canceled Batgirl Film?</span></a>
