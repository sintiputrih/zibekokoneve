While love is seemingly in her future, Molzahn also took a moment to reflect on past heartbreak.</p><p>Sitting alongside Harrison, actor <strong>Paul Scheer</strong>, and co-host <strong>Jenny Mollen</strong>, Molzahn fielded a question from a fan who asked about Locke and the <a href=#>recent arrival of his newborn baby</a> with his girlfriend, <strong>Samm Murphy</strong>.</p><p>“There was no motivation in coming on the show in the sense of like, ‘I’m gonna get back at him,’ in no way,” Molzahn explained when asked whether Locke’s son, <strong>Koltyn</strong>, influenced her decision to go on the dating show. “The opportunity came and I was ready to move forward. It actually happened that on the day that we walked into paradise, I had been single for a complete year, a full year. It was just a perfect day to start a brand new chapter.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Molzahn and Locke started dating on the first season of ABC’s Bachelor Pad in 2010, and spent the next few years together before splitting in 2014.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I hung onto that relationship for a long time. It was something very special to me… There were a lot of pieces of me that developed, I guess,” Molzahn continued. “When the opportunity came up, I was very single. I was already… my heart was healed and ready to move forward.”</p><p>The Bachelor in Paradise star has enough closure that she recently met Murphy, Locke’s girlfriend and the mother of his child. Locke, who is raising Koltyn&nbsp;with his new love, <a href=#>told Us</a> the little boy is “healthy and happy.”</p><p>“I got to meet the mom of the baby and she’s wonderful, she really is,” Molzahn said of the new mother. “It could’ve been awkward but it wasn’t… There’s a baby that’s in this world now and that’s a little life and they’re doing their life, and now it’s my turn to do mine.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatnZ6hsrp5zKijs5mYo3qqwsRmpJ6sXZrFbrfIqauypqNitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXq0tMSsZLCnnpmys7LUpWRraGFqfnKEjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mireddys-gonzalez-who-is-daddy-yankees-wife.html><span>←</span><span>Mireddys Gonzlez: Who is Daddy Yankees wife?</span></a>
