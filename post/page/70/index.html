In 1325, the Italian city-states of Bologna and Modena engaged in a short-lived war that allegedly started when Modenese soldiers stole a wooden bucket.During the Medieval period, what we know today as Italy was not a unified country, and it wouldn‚Äôt be fully unified until 1871. Italy was once fragmented into various city-states, duchies, and kingdoms that were all governed independently and had their own traditions, languages, cultures, and politics. Given all these stark differences, it was not unusual for Italy‚Äôs provinces to come into conflict with each other ‚Äî and one of the oddest conflicts of all was the War of the Bucket.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>We Want Britney Spears to Be Our &amp;quot;Auntie,&amp;quot; Too, After Seeing Her Sweet Playdate With Lance Basss</h2><time>Jun 25, 2024</time>

We saw this with the first generation iPhone and Apple TV, both of which saw completely new designs in their second incarnations.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Katherine McNamara to Star as Clary in ABC Familys Shadowhunters</h2><time>Jun 24, 2024</time>
