<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Cory Monteith's Last Few Hours Reenacted on 'Autopsy'</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><i>Glee</i> fans were left distraught and dismayed when 31-year-old <b><a href=#>Cory Monteith</a></b> was found <a href=#>dead in his Vancouver hotel room</a> July 13, 2013. A new TV special, <i>Autopsy: The Last Hours of Cory Monteith</i>, seeks to give them some closure by focusing on his tragic passing, as seen in <i>Us Weekly</i>‘s exclusive sneak peek.</p><p>The Reelz series will examine the timeline of events, as well as medical evidence, behind the actor’s death, on its Saturday, December 3, episode. According to<i> Autopsy</i>, Monteith — who played quarterback Finn Hudson on the Emmy-winning Fox musical series — was caught on camera returning alone to his 21st-floor British Columbia hotel room at 2:16 a.m. the morning of his death.</p><p>“Precisely what happens next is unknown,” forensic pathologist Michael Hunter<b> </b>says in the clip. “But 10 hours later, hotel staff find him collapsed on the floor, and near him on a table was a spoon with heroin residue, as well as a hypodermic needle.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>In the preview clip, Monteith, portrayed by an actor, is shown walking to his hotel room alone; the reenactment is designed to signify the real hotel footage captured in the final hours of his life. The scene is followed by the forensic team combing through Monteith’s coroner’s report, zooming in on key phrases in the report, including “locked room,” “unresponsive” and “a spoon with drug residue.”</p><p><i>Us</i>&nbsp;reported on April 1, 2013, that Monteith was entering rehab for substance addiction. In a previously released clip exclusive to <i>Us</i> of this<i> Autopsy</i> episode, the actor is <a href=#>portrayed during a meeting</a> with<i> Glee</i> creator <b>Ryan Murphy</b> as they discuss Monteith taking a break from the show for substance-abuse issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Monteith did not appear in<i> Glee</i>‘s final two episodes of season 4, as they were filmed while he was seeking treatment, and he died before production began on season 5. (The cause of death was a mixture of heroin and alcohol.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Watch the preview clip above. <i>Autopsy: The Last Hours of Cory Monteith </i>airs on Reelz Saturday, December 3, at 8 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqoqqliurC6056graCjYrmiv9NmnZ6vXZ28tr7SZqmenZ6WsLWxw2amp2WRqsGwvNKyZLBsZWiCd3yO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anna-leong-brophy-net-worth-287617.html><span>←</span><span>Anna Leong Brophy Net Worth 2024</span></a>
