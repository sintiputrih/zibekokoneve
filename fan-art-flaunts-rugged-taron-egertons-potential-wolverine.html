Of all the suitable candidates that have been thrown around though, the one that truly stands out as a viable option is Rocketman star Taron Egerton.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>There’ve been several <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fan-made depictions</a> of the Golden Globe-winning actor as the enigmatic member of the X-Men, leading all who witness these enticing designs to seriously start to subscribe to the idea of him taking over the coveted role. And the latest Wolverine artwork to pop up features the Kingsman star fully embracing the rugged Hugh Jackman look.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>Digital artist Britedit has created an excellent design for the next potential MCU Wolverine. This well-crafted piece has Egerton rocking the signature goatee, hairstyle and adamantium claws as well as the yellow costume from the comics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/85239647_172536994052384_5877297875286182670_n.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>Obviously, this would be an excellent look for Logan’s debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It’s very reminiscent of Jackman’s style with a fresh new costume while still staying true to the source material. The result is a satisfying mix of both old and new that fans of all ages can get behind.</p><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=886 data-injectable=true>Of course, there’s no question that Egerton has what it takes to play a superhero, but filling Jackman’s shoes is a huge responsibility. The rumors of him portraying the character have also been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">downplayed by the actor</a> and despite the fan approval, he doesn’t believe<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he’s the right choice for the part</a>. Other big names like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Radcliffe</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Hardy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Eastwood</a>&nbsp;and even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stranger Things star Dacre Montgomery</a> have all been photoshopped into Wolverine as of late, so there are certainly several options out there to choose from for Marvel.</p><p data-characters=121 data-current-count=121 data-injectable=false>Tell us, though, who would be your first choice for the MCU’s <strong>Wolverine</strong>?
