Focused on a boy named Twenty-Fifth Baam and his quest to find his friend Rachel, Tower of God revolves around a mysterious Tower that has been divided into many floors, each floor with its own civilization and independent kingdoms.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Every person in the anime has Shinsu, a substance with magic-like abilities, and uses it to fight gravity-defying battles required to ascend the levels of the tower. The strongest characters are classified according to their ability to control Shinsu, with the title of Ranker bestowed upon those who have reached the 134th floor of the Tower.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=719 data-injectable=true>There are several divisions in the ranker system, with the top 10% known as Advanced Rankers and the top 1% as High Rankers. During the anime’s first season, fans were introduced to several strong Rankers, as well as many other strong characters that could also give a High Ranker a run for their money.&nbsp;Here are 10 of the strongest characters in Tower Of God so far.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>10. Twenty-Fifth Baam</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tliz5go54sf51.jpg><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>Thanks to his possession of two thorns, Baam is known for his ability to quickly learn new techniques and attacks by simply seeing them once. Also, He is a skilled martial artist and a great Shinsu controller. His potential is untapped. “25th Baam Style Wave Explosion” and “Wide Range Shinsu Controller – Rainfall” are his most powerful moves.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>9. Evankhell</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TOG-Manhwa-Evankhell-Full-Form-Part-3-1.jpg><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>Evankhell, also known as “The Infernal Evankhell,” is high-ranking and was once the ruler of the second level. She is very disciplined and strict. She is a great Shinsu controller, and her abilities are nearly comparable to those of the 10 Great Families. “Fiery Elephant” and “Rare Inferno Orb” are her most deadly moves.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>8. Kallavan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TOG-Manhwa-Kallavan-Essence-of-Bravery-Part-3-Ep-41.jpg><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>As the Fourth Army Corp commander, Kallavan can surpass the 10 Great Families with his “Essence of Bravery.” He is a strong fighter who specializes in hand-to-hand combat.&nbsp;</p><h3 data-injectable=false>7. Po Bidau Gustang</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TOG-Manhwa-Po-Bidau-Gustang-Part-2.jpg><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true>Po Bidau Gustang is the chief of the Po Bidau family, which is part of 10 Great Families. Also, He is one of the tower’s most well-known Wave controllers and is highly feared. He is also an expert in science and medicine. “Soul Extraction” and “Memory Manipulation” are his signature moves.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>6. Ha Yurin</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EUfU1tQU4AAh_ys.jpg><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>Ha Yurin is the leader of the Ha family, which is part of the 10 Great Families. Hand-to-hand combat is her specialty, making her an excellent scout to conduct on-the-ground reconnaissance. Blessed with intelligence and a strong physique, she acted both as the Fisherman and Scout during battles</p><h3 data-injectable=false>5. Khun Eudan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/00000570206.jpg><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=746 data-injectable=true>Khun Eudan is the chief of the Khun family, which is one of 10 Great Families. He is second only to Arie Hon in power among the heads of the 10 Great Families. He is a master at spear-bearing and is the God of Spears in Tower. His deadly attacks include “Lightening Shinsu” and “Eudan Style Spear.” Together with Zahard and other family heads, he climbed the tower to make a contract for immortality with the floor rulers.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>4. Aries Hon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/images-2.jpeg><p data-characters=107 data-current-count=407 data-injectable=true>Aries Hon is the chief of the Arie family, another part of the 10 Great Families, and the father to White.</p><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>As an expert swordsman, Arie wields the White Oar, the only S+ rank sword made by Macseth, which he uses with his high-density Shinsoo. Residing at the 100th floor of the tower, Arie usually issues a challenge for regulars to endure his attacks for 10 minutes. Only two people have completed the challenge thus far: Urek Mazino and his daughter, Arie Hagipherione Zahard.</p><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>His true powers are still unknown, so there is much mystery surrounding him. He is the most influential leader of the 10 Great Families.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>3. Urek Mazino</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/EWz7lwqXkAAtx40.jpg><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>Before Zahard arrived, Urek was the most powerful person in the tower. Climbing the tower in only 50 years, he is the fastest and the strongest in the history of Rankers. Urek’s power can only be explained as that of a beast as he once evaded Slayer Karaka’s most powerful attack using only 1% of his power.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>His extreme physical strength is enough to defeat any enemy with one punch. In addition, his agility gives him an extra edge as an expert in Shinsu and other martial arts. So far, “Supreme Kings Scorching Fist Of Death” is known to be his most deadly move.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>2. Zahard&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tog2.jpg><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>He is the King and the most powerful and influential being in Tower of God. He is a keen Shinsu Controller who can see the future and control the fate of others. After climbing the floors of the tower, he decided to reign over the tower as a King and as a result, was the first one to make a contract with the guardian of the towers. He is a keen Shinsu controller, and has the ability to see the future and to control the fate of others.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>He also has the “Needle of War,” a deadly weapon that Zahard uses only against those he recognizes as his opponent. The weapon is composed of three stages that change color depending on its strength. Currently, Zahard is the most intimidating force and is often feared by everyone.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>1. Enryu</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/TOG-Manhwa-Enryu-Floor-of-Death-Part.jpg><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=false>Enryu is the only person to have killed an administrator of a level, which just so happened to be the Floor of Death administrator, an entity that many thought to be unkillable. Enryu has a level of Shinsu Control that is almost unmatched in the tower. His most dangerous move, “Red Rain,” is a series of thousands of spears falling from the sky, the same move he used to kill the Floor of Death administrator.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn6hlkaeybsDHnmSsrKKku6ix0q1knKCRp66kwMSrqmahnmLBsMPEq2Sonl2cvKV7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tiktok-stars-chris-olsen-ian-paget-explain-what-led-to-their-breakup.html><span>←</span><span>TikTok Stars Chris Olsen &amp;amp; Ian Paget Explain What Led to Their Breakup</span></a>
