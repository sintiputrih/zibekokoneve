By Douglas Helm | Updated 11 months ago Marvel has been keeping a pretty tight lid on the details of Samuel L. Jackson’s Disney+ series, but now we’re finally starting to get a good picture of what the series will look like. Namely, Emilia Clarke’s role in Secret Invasion has been confirmed. Vanity Fair recently did an in-depth profile of the series and revealed that Clarke will be playing a Skrull named G’iah (pronounced “Guy-ah”) who is the daughter of Ben Mendelsohn’s Talos."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Jackson’s <a href=#>Disney+</a> series, but now we’re finally starting to get a good picture of what the series will look like. Namely, Emilia Clarke’s role in Secret Invasion has been confirmed. <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a> recently did an in-depth profile of the series and revealed that Clarke will be playing a Skrull named G’iah (pronounced “Guy-ah”) who is the daughter of Ben Mendelsohn’s Talos.</p><p>It was also revealed that we’ve technically seen <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Emilia Clarke" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Emilia Clarke</a>‘s Secret Invasion character in the MCU before, albeit as a much younger Skrull. In <a href=#>Captain Marvel</a>, we briefly meet Talos’ family, including his wife and daughter. The daughter seen in those brief scenes is Clarke’s character, but she’s obviously all grown up now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/G-iah-Captain-Marvel-1-skrull-900x506.jpg><p>It appears that Emilia Clarke’s character will also be antagonistic in Secret Invasion, as she’s not exactly thrilled with how her dad has been handling the Skrull situation. In the show, a faction of the Skrulls is tired of waiting for Jackson’s Nick Fury to find them the home he promised them in Captain <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Marvel data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Marvel</a>, which leads to a radicalized resistance led by a Skrull named Gravik (Kingsley Ben-Adir). Clarke’s character will be a part of this resistance, which will obviously lead to some conflict with her dad and Fury.</p><p>Along with Emilia Clarke’s new(ish) character in Secret Invasion, we’ll also be introduced to Olivia Colman’s MI6 agent who also will be an antagonistic force for fury. According to the article, her motivations on the surface are protecting the national security interests of England, but shifting and hidden motivations are rampant in the series. It seems that everyone’s intentions won’t always be immediately apparent in this Cold War-esque series.</p><p>Along with new faces like Emilia Clarke and Colman, there will be plenty of familiar faces playing a role in Secret Invasion as well. Of course, <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Samuel L. Jackson" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Samuel L. Jackson</a> is taking lead and will be working with Ben Mendelsohn’s Talos again, but he’ll also run into other MCU familiars along the way. His right hand, Colbie Smulders’ Maria Hill, will be a frequent presence on the show.</p><p>Fury will also be running into the CIA’s Everett K Ross (Martin Freeman) and James “Rodey” Rhodes (<a href=#>Don Cheadle</a>), who will likely be friendlier presences to help Fury navigate these tricky waters. This definitely seems like it’s going to be a more grounded entry to the MCU (not including the shape-shifting <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=aliens data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>aliens</a>) that falls more in line with their political thrillers like Captain America: Civil War. The motivations of Emilia Clarke and Kingsley Ben-Adir’s characters in Secret Invasion have ties to real-world issues as well, so this could potentially be one of the best Disney+ MCU projects yet.</p><p>We won’t have too much longer to wait to see Emilia Clarke and the rest of the cast in Secret Invasion, as the series is scheduled to hit Disney+ on June 21. The series will be six episodes long and will be the first TV series of the MCU’s Phase 5. In the meantime, you can still check out the MCU’s latest film <a href=#>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</a> in theaters.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2idnZ65qq2MnKOaqpuaerSxwqucrWWZo8Oiv8iopWabmJa%2Foq%2FTnqlnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./christian-atsu-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Christian Atsu Net Worth 2024</span></a>
