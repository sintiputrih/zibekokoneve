Her hit "212" and the way she meshed house music with hip-hop made her a force to be reckoned with. With so much potential and innovative&nbsp;creativity lodged in her mind, she seems to have dug a grave for herself based solely on her actions and her words. Rarely do we ever hear about Azealia's musical efforts these days. If somebody brings her up, it's likely to discuss the fact that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she once claimed to sacrifice chickens in her closet</a>. Or it might be for the rants she pulls daily on her social media channels. Or... you get the point. Today, she shared a preview of one of her new songs, which got people talking because of the extremely suggestive subject matter.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The last time we heard Banks on record was&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">when she dropped her single "Playhouse."</a> Last month, the song was released and much like this one, her lyrics were graphic. She spoke about her "playhouse" and about all kinds of sex she wanted to have inside of it. Now, she's teasing two new tracks and of them, one stands out as a raunchy display of Azealia's dirty thoughts. She raps: "Said you wanna be my boyfriend/But you better make me c*m/Got the pinkest p***y/And you know that p***y warm/I just wanna keep you hard/I don't wanna miss a minute."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiZ352fZZmmLOdkaG2onnBmqWkq12lv6bCyJ6urGWVrcGzscyeo7JlnqizuHnNnq5mq5%2BjtG66xLCq</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./will-jada-pinkett-smith-shielded-children-from-marriage-issues.html><span>←</span><span>Will Smith &amp;amp; Jada Pinkett Smith &amp;quot;Shielded&amp;quot; Kids from Marital Woes</span></a>
