During the interview, Francis spoke about a pitch he laid out to Bray Wyatt and Bo Dallas based on the horror movie Leprechaun in the Hood.</p><p>“I pitched the idea to Bray and to Bo about the movie. It’s gonna sound ridiculous,” AJ Francis said. “If you’ve never seen it, it’s so bad that it’s good. It’s called Leprechaun in the Hood. Okay, it’s one of the worst best movies ever. It stars Ice-T. Basically, it’s the fifth movie in a Leprechaun installment, okay.</p><p>“And the whole premises movie is like a comedy horror movie where, like this Leprechaun, you got this golden flute that brings you all this good luck. But then he’s trying to kill you to get his flute back. That’s the whole premise of the film. So, at the time, Bray hadn’t done anything in the Firefly Funhouse yet. And that was obviously a big part of his development as a character.</p><p>“So I pitched this idea to them like Leprechaun in the Hood, I was like, look, we’re walking down this hallway, and we look down this dark spooky hallway, and there’s light at the end of the tunnel, and there’s like a sign, and it says, abandon hope all ye who enter or whatever it is. And B-Fab’s like, ‘What’s that?’ And I’m like, ‘I don’t know, but I ain’t trying to find out.’</p><p>“And she’s like, ‘What? You scared?’ I ain’t no punk bitch, I ain’t scared of nothing. Me being Top Dolla. Meanwhile, I’ve seen every horror movie ever, and Black people don’t last long, right? So we walk in, and it’s the Firefly Funhouse. And we’ve stumbled across it. There’s cobwebs everywhere. All the little puppets like Sister Abigail, they’re all like facedown, not moving.</p><p>“It’s clear that nobody’s been there for a while. And I see Rambling Rabbit, and I’m like, oh man, this is crazy. It’s the real Rambling Rabbit, and I pick him up. And as soon as I pick him up, the room starts going crazy. Lights start flashing, and dolls are coming to life, and it’s just like a scary, funny scene, just like in the stupid Leprechaun movie.</p><p>“And we’re, like, let’s get out of here, and we run away, but I keep Rambling Rabbit, right? But as we’re running away, you just see Uncle Howdy’s face in the shadow, in the background. And you’re like, oh, they done fucked up. But now I got Rambling Rabbit, and he’s a rabbit, you know, lucky rabbit’s foot. We got good luck.</p><p>“So, at this point, we haven’t won in a while. So now we’re winning matches. Things are going our way. So then now when human Bray comes to us as like, ‘Look, man. I know you have Rambling Rabbit. I just want him back. Please just give me Rambling Rabbit back. He belongs with his pals.’ I thought this out. This is like a long-ass note.</p><p>“I wrote this whole thing out. I texted it to him, and he loved it. And he’s like, just give him back to us, and we’ll just let bygones be bygones. And me, once again, playing the character Top Dolla. I’m like, ‘Nah, things are finally going right. We got good luck. Nah, Bray, I’m not scared of all that spooky you do, bro. Things going good for Hit Row now. I don’t give a damn what you got to say.’</p><p>“And now that’s where I f**ked up right there. And now he’s like, okay, I didn’t want to take it there, and now the same way he was stalking LA Knight, and shit was getting scary. He was gonna do that with all of us. He was gonna pick us off one by one until it’s finally me and Rambling Rabbit, and now we got to finally have a match. But then Tahootie comes and intervenes.</p><p>“That’s how you get on Uncle Howdy in, and then now you do us, and then B-Fab intervenes, and we even wrote in there to bring Alexa [Bliss] in, and then there’s a long storyline that ends with them obviously getting Rambling Rabbit back and then kicking our ass, and they loved it.</p><p>“And he was talking about how he wanted to do it after Mania because, at Mania, he was supposed to do a thing with Bobby Lashley, but then obviously he got sick unfortunately. But he loved it. He loved the idea. And what was cool to me is that, like someone who I respect their ideas so much, and I respect what they’ve done to revolutionize wrestling, heard my idea and was like, ‘That’s a great idea.'”</p><p><a href=#>AJ Francis Appears At GCW, Will Face Joey Janela On 1/26</a></p><p>What do you make of AJ Francis’ comments?
