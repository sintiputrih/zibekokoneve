This area was under the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, a part of Czechoslovakia that was ceded to Nazi Germany, in fact, after the Second World War, the Bouchet family was placed in a resettlement camp in the German area controlled by America, which which made it possible to emigrate to the United States soon. Here she was first hosted by a California Five Points family, then moved to San Francisco. In the Californian metropolis, Bouchet joins a dance group, <strong>The KPIX Dance Party</strong>, known on local TV for their shows.</p><p>After this three-year experience in 1962, he later settled in Hollywood to attempt a film career, it was in the latter period that he decided to change his last name. Her debut as an actress was in comedy <strong>The lady and her husbands </strong>(1964) in a secondary part, the girl dressed in a bikini on the plane of Rod Anderson, played by <strong>Robert Mitchum</strong>. This small appearance allows her to be cast in other films of the 60s, always in roles of small importance, which, however, begin to put her in the first spotlight; in fact in 1965 still seventeen years old plays a supporting role, an unfaithful wife, in <strong>First victory</strong> of <strong>Otto Preminger</strong> with <strong>John Wayne </strong>is<strong> Kirk Douglas</strong>.

While in Italy to take part in <strong>Sweet Charity</strong> (1969) by <strong>Bob Fosse</strong>, he knows <strong>Piero Zuffi</strong> than writing for the detective <strong>Hot shot</strong> (1969), from this moment Bouchet began working in the Italian boot, becoming one of the stars of the Italian sexy comedy.</p><p>The fame and the great work presented to her convince her to settle in Italy, where she is offered leading roles between gags, misunderstandings and nudity. These are years of work like <strong>Duck with orange</strong> (1975), <strong>For the ancient stairs</strong> (1975), <strong>40 degrees in the shade of the sheet</strong> (1976), <strong>How to lose a wife and find a lover</strong> (1978), <strong>Licorice</strong> (1979) and <strong>Saturday, Sunday and Friday</strong> (1979) and many others, where the actress, ranging from yellow to comedy, from erotic to thriller, always plays that role of seductive and attractive character in its various shades. For years he has been working with other greats of Italian cinema, such as <strong>Marcello Mastroianni</strong>, <strong>Monica Vitti</strong>, <strong>Michele Placido</strong>,<strong> Vittorio Gassman</strong>, <strong>Mario Monicelli</strong>, just to name a few.</p><p>With the advent of the 80s, the sexy comedy begins to decline and Bouchet focuses on television and theater career, often collaborating with the duo <strong>Ciccio Ingrassia</strong> is <strong>Franco Franchi</strong>, however, without neglecting the film commitments, such as <strong>Spaghetti at midnight</strong> (1981), and also receiving international assignments, such as the miniseries <strong>Scarlet and black</strong> (1983) with <strong>Gregory Peck</strong> is <strong>Christopher Plummer</strong>.
