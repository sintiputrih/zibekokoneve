There’s no harm in giving it a shot – the green juice is supposed to have some amazing benefits.&nbsp;<a data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Express.co.uk</a>&nbsp;reveals why you might want to consider drinking the ‘powerful and miraculous’ drink every single day, according to the Medical Medium, and chatted to Dr Deborah Lee from <a data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link rel=nofollow href=#>Dr Fox Online Pharmacy</a> to find out if the science checks out.</p><p>No studies have been done on celery juice and its healing powers, but people following the Medical Medium movement reported incredible results.</p><p>Anthony William, author of Medical Medium Celery Juice: The Most Powerful Medicine of Our Time Healing Millions Worldwide is trying to spread the word about the ‘incredible healing properties’ of celery juice, which are still largely undiscovered.</p><p>He wrote on his website: “The miracle herbal remedy that is celery juice is here for the chronically ill – for anyone who lives with a symptom or condition. It’s here for you.</p><p>“Medical research and science will someday catch up with the millions of people who have found healing with celery juice — the ones who have discovered more energy and stamina than ever, reversed chronic and acute conditions alike, and gotten their lives back.</p><p>“They will someday discover that celery juice is not a fad or a hiccup. They will find that it is — objectively — a healing medicine of our time.”</p><p>Dr Deborah Lee from Dr Fox Online Pharmacy isn’t so sure there’s anything special about this diet, though.</p><p>She said: “The Medical Medium must be congratulated on encouraging people to consume more plant foods, including celery, which is likely to be beneficial for health.</p><p>“However, all fruits and vegetables are well known to be good for our health. In fact, the current recommendation is to eat 10 portions a day – but this is not psychic. It is common sense!”</p><p><strong>READ MORE-&nbsp;<a data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=noopener>Christopher Dean takes medication to control progressive condition</a></strong></p><p>If you’re going to try drinking celery juice every day, The Medical Medium said you must take pure celery juice on an empty stomach first thing in the morning.</p><p>He recommended drinking a glass or more with no other ingredients 15 to 30 minutes before your breakfast.</p><p>You must eat your breakfast afterwards because celery juice is “medicinal” not “caloric”.<br>Use organic celery if you can, or just make sure you wash non-organic celery especially well before juicing.</p><p>Dr Lee, on the other hand, reckoned there’s no way you can get enough goodness from juicing celery as opposed to eating it whole.</p><p>She said: “Celery is rich in phytochemicals, and no doubt has health-giving properties, but there is no benefit from juicing, instead of eating raw celery. In fact, juicing lowers the fibre content of the celery and reduces its health benefits.”</p><p>On top of this, Dr Lee said the pulp – what remains of the fruit or vegetable after the juice has been removed – is really beneficial because it contains “a large number of vitamins, minerals and all-important fibre”.</p><p>She added: “Nutritionists have studied this and found a greater quantity of antioxidants in fruit juices where the pulp has been left in.”</p><h2>The seven claimed benefits of celery juice</h2><h2>Acid reflux</h2><p>The Medical Medium said celery juice is “critical” for acid reflux.</p><p>He explained on his site: “Acid reflux means three things are happening: low hydrochloric acid production, unproductive bacteria such as strep and e.Coli and a weakened liver. Celery juice helps improve these.”</p><p>However, some gastroenterologists said vitamins and minerals should not be taken on an empty stomach as they are likely to cause GI symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhoea, so it’s not certain how this could help acid reflux.</p><h2>Bloating</h2><p>If you suffer from bloating, you might benefit from celery juicing, he said.</p><p>Mr William argued: “Celery juice is a powerful stomach acid replenisher so that gastric juices can kill strep, which causes SIBO.</p><p>“It also breaks down rotting protein and rancid fats in the stomach & small intestinal tract, helping bloating.”</p><p>Celery is a low FODMAP food (a fermentable carbohydrate), and a low FODMAP diet has been shown to improve bowel symptoms in patients suffering from IBS. This could be why celery juice helps to reduce bloating in some people.</p><p><strong>DON’T MISS…</strong><br><strong><a data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=noopener>Covid vaccine latest: AstraZeneca now linked to ‘transverse myelitis’</a>&nbsp;[INFORMER]</strong><br><strong><a data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=noopener>Alzheimer’s: The food that may trigger the onset of dementia</a>&nbsp;[INSIGHT]</strong><br><strong><a data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=noopener>High cholesterol: Two colours in your fingers could be warning signs</a>&nbsp;[EXPLAINER]</strong></p><h2>Reverse chronic illness</h2><p>The Medical Medium’s views are highly controversial, but people with numerous chronic illnesses have said that celery juice has helped to reverse their chronic illnesses.</p><p>The author said: “Celery juice’s undiscovered sodium cluster salts act together as an antiseptic.</p><p>“When they make contact with viruses & bacteria —troublemakers responsible for chronic illness — the salts begin to break down the pathogens’ cell membranes, eventually destroying them.”</p><p>Despite searching, Dr Lee said there appeared to be no such thing as cluster salt.</p><p>She explained: “Although celery has a relatively high salt (sodium) content for a vegetable, dietician’s state that it can be eaten, even by those on a low salt diet.</p><p>“I would personally stress the relatively high potassium content of celery, which may underlie the possible effects it can have on lowering your blood pressure.”</p><h2></h2><h2>Liver toxins</h2><p>The author wrote that celery juice helped to neutralise and flush toxins out of the liver</p><p>He said: “Celery juice’s sodium cluster salts bind onto neurotoxins, derma toxins and other viral waste, as well as troublemakers and draw them out of the liver.”</p><p>In reality, no one really knows what is meant by ‘cleanse and detox’.</p><p>Dr Lee said: “Some people claim various products detox and cleanse by stimulating the liver and kidney to remove toxins from the body – but there is no medical evidence that this is the case.</p><p>“Your body has a natural ability to cope with toxins and whether cucumber juice or any other substance activates this better than any other is not known.”</p><p>Our liver takes a beating through a poor diet and too much alcohol, but celery juice could help, added Mr William.</p><p>He said: “Celery juice repairs hydrochloric acid and liver bile production.</p><p>“It strengthens hydrochloric acid, bile production and the liver, which then allows for better bile production.”</p><p>This might sound impressive, but Dr Lee said healthy people do not have liver toxicity, so drinking so much celery juice for this purpose is unnecessary.</p><h2>Kills bacteria and viruses</h2><p>According to Mr William, drinking the green juice daily helped to eradicate strep bacteria.</p><p>He said strep is responsible for many conditions like acne, UTIs, SIBO and yeast infections.</p><p>The author also said celery juice can kill Epstein-Barr and Shingles viruses.</p><p>He explained on his website: “The white blood cells of the liver’s personalised immune system add the cluster salts to their cell membrane coatings, making them toxic to viruses.”</p><p>Celery contains high levels of vitamin C, which has been shown to help kill Epstein Barr virus in mice with lymphoma. But this does not necessarily mean it will have the same effect on healthy humans.</p><p>Dr Lee said: “In a group of rats with MRSA infection, a 0.2 percent celery cream showed the strongest recovery in terms of wound healing compared to other creams tested.</p><p>“Although these are interesting results and positive observations, they are small studies on animals and the results cannot be assumed to simply translate to humans.”</p><p>Post source: <a href=#>Daily Express</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KoraKcXWaGcK%2FEpZyrsV2fwqqvxGaZnqaVm7a1v4ysn6itnJl6urvUZp%2BarpViwamxjKagq5mTqrmwwdJmm6uhnqB6pa3IpbBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./billboard-music-awards-2021-everything-to-know.html><span>←</span><span>Billboard Music Awards 2021: Everything to Know</span></a>
