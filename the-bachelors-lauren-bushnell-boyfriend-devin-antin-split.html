Bachelor Nation’s <strong>Lauren Bushnell</strong> and her boyfriend, <strong>Devin Antin</strong>, have called it quits after more than one year of dating, multiple sources confirm exclusively to Us Weekly.</p><p>Bushnell, 28, who last shared a photo with her former beau on Instagram on July 8, no longer follows Antin on the social media platform.</p><p>Us confirmed in July 2017 that Bushnell<a href=#> had started dating Antin two months after her split</a> from <strong><a href=#>Ben Higgins</a></strong>. The former flight attendant and Higgins, 30, got engaged during the season 20 finale of The Bachelor, which aired in March 2016. They announced their breakup in May 2017.</p><p>Bushnell later revealed she<a href=#> met Antin on Tinder a year before competing for Higgins’ heart</a> on The Bachelor.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I don’t think I’ve shared before but I only met up with one person from the app and it was him,” the <a href=#>Dear Rosé</a> cofounder wrote during an Instagram Q&A with fans in October 2017. “We hung out for a while but more as friends but always got along really well. Fast forward two years later when I moved back to L.A. we hung out to catch up and things just kinda happened after that.”</p><p>More recently, Bushnell admitted exclusively to Us Weekly that she is a <a href=#>“bit overly cautious” with her love life</a> after her time on the ABC dating series.</p><p>“I’ve always been someone who maybe jumps into things a little too quickly and I fall really fast,” the reality TV personality told&nbsp;Us on August 6. “And I always had this idea that I was going to be married by this age, kids, and this was going to be my plan … and now, I mean I’m almost 29 but I don’t really have a timestamp on anything anymore, which is nice. And maybe I should a little more. But I think going through the past and my past engagement and&nbsp;The Bachelor has made me want to just take things a little bit slower and not rush anything.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJVir6Kvx56jqKqjYrmiwdGepWaapai1r7HLpWSbp6mbv6qxzZ1knZ2mnrturc2toKdlo6W5qsCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./somer-hollingsworth-net-worth-185486.html><span>←</span><span>Somer Hollingsworth Net Worth</span></a>
