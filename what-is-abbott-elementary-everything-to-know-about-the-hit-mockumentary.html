The fairly adaptable format was once the go-to for some of TV’s most popular sitcoms - from ABC’s Modern Family to <a href=#><strong>The Office</strong></a>, and even Parks and Recreation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For many fans who have been nostalgic for this particular structure of storytelling, ABC has presented them with a new fix: the now widely-acclaimed series, Abbott Elementary. Penned, produced and starring internet sensation and comedian Quinta Brunson, the new hit show is set in the titular, cash-strapped, fictional public school in Philadelphia.</p><p>At Abbott Elementary, the needs are great, but the budget is slim, often forcing the very quirky staff members to go to ridiculous lengths to be great teachers, despite the odds being firmly stacked against them. The unique concept is well written, and then delivered by the cast, making for compelling viewing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'The Office' Has One Major Regret From The Show</a></span></p><p>If you haven’t come around to watching Abbott Elementary yet, here is everything you need to know about this fresh sitcom that is taking over the internet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lsquo-abbott-elementary-rsquo-is-based-on-a-real-life-character><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>‘Abbott Elementary’ Is Based On A Real-Life Character</span></h2><p>Abbott Elementary is in fact based on creator, Quinta Brunson’s real-life middle school teacher, Ms. Abbott. Joyce Abbott now works as a climate manager at Andrew Hamilton Elementary in West Philadelphia, and reportedly remembers every one of her old students.</p><p>It seems that the inverse is true as well: “Ms. Abbott has always stuck with me throughout my life,” Brunson said of her former teacher, adding that she always went ‘above and beyond.’</p><h2 id=lsquo-abbott-elementary-rsquo-features-an-ensemble-cast><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>‘Abbott Elementary’ Features An Ensemble Cast</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the things that appears to have really struck a chord with fans is the fact that each character on the show brings their own unique, magnetic eccentricity. Quinta Brunson stars as Janine Teagues, a charming and severely optimistic second-grade teacher. There is also the hilarious Melissa Schemmenti, portrayed by Lisa Ann Walter <a href=#>from the cast of the classic ‘90s film, The Parent Trap</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Facts About 'The Parent Trap' That Will Blow Any '90s Kid's Mind</a></span></p><p>Janelle James has particularly become a fan favorite, as the ethically compromised principal, Ava Coleman. Everybody Hates Chris’ Tyler James Williams plays Gregory Eddy, a temporary sub who is always a constant target of Ava’s inappropriate flirting.</p><h2 id=lsquo-abbott-elementary-rsquo-is-not-filmed-in-philadelphia><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>‘Abbott Elementary’ Is Not Filmed In Philadelphia</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being inspired by Brunson’s former school in West Philadelphia, Abbott Elementary is actually filmed in LA. The story world of the sitcom is, however, set in Philly, and the show incorporates several references to the culture of Pennsylvania’s largest city.</p><p>Episode 4, for instance, saw Janine teaching local slang words, such as ‘jawn,’ ‘ard’ and ‘boul’ to her class.</p><h2 id=lsquo-abbott-elementary-rsquo-is-breaking-the-ratings><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>‘Abbott Elementary’ Is Breaking The Ratings</span></h2><p>In an impressive feat, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Abbott Elementary became the first ever ABC comedy to quadruple its ratings</a> since its premiere. The sitcom is clearly growing on fans, with social media awash with praise for its brilliance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Abbott Elementary is my new obsession! It has awkwardness, but realness to it, that resonates with me. I bet teachers are exactly like this, and that’s what makes it a super funny show!” one fan remarked on Twitter.</p><h2 id=lsquo-abbott-elementary-rsquo-offers-social-commentary-for-real-life-issues-rsquo><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>‘Abbott Elementary’ Offers Social Commentary For Real-Life Issues’</span></h2><p>With Abbott Elementary, Brunson created a show that not only entertains, but also uniquely details the plight of the everyday struggles in the public school system in America.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Parasite: The Most Relevant Social Commentary of Our Time</a></span></p><p>‘The workplace under the microscope in this sitcom is a West Philadelphia public school that’s typical of its subject,’ <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Guardian review of the sitcom</a> reads. ‘It’s too true to the woeful state of public education in America to seem like it could be funny.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=teachers-say-they-can-relate-to-the-sitcom><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Teachers Say They Can Relate To The Sitcom</span></h2><p>The real-life impact of Abbott Elementary has been undeniable, with actual teachers coming out in praise of the show.</p><p>Vidya Karra is one of such, who took to Twitter to express gratitude for the validation teachers are able to get from the sitcom. ‘Quinta - this month has been the hardest month of my 10-year teaching career and Abbott Elementary has brought me so much joy and support! Thank you to your incredible work and advocacy for educators,’ she wrote.</p><h2 id=lsquo-abbott-elementary-rsquo-is-a-nod-to-an-older-age-of-tv-sitcoms><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>‘Abbott Elementary’ Is A Nod To An Older Age Of TV Sitcoms</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Abbott Elementary has uniquely appealed to fans of a particular age group because it takes them back to a different era of television sitcoms. Apart from The Office, Modern Family and Parks and Rec, the Quinta Brunson series has also been likened to shows such The Muppets and Boy Meets World, which also predominantly took place within a school context.</p><p>Another key element of Abbott Elementary is how the characters often break the fourth wall, a throwback to older sitcoms such as Saved by the Bell and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.</p><h2 id=the-cast-of-39-abbott-elementary-39-has-several-black-leads><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>The Cast Of 'Abbott Elementary' Has Several Black Leads</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shows such as Insecure, Black-ish and Atlanta have arguably made the modern era of television a golden one for Black representation on the small screen. With a predominantly African-American cast, this is definitely one of the things that Brunson had in mind when creating Abbott Elementary.</p><p>“It’s absolutely part of what I was setting out to do,” she recently said. “I just could not think of many workplace sitcoms with Black leads. Most of the recent ones, there is only one Black person. Whereas where I’ve come from, most of the workplaces were predominantly Black people, and I wanted to show that.”</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Things You Need To Know Before Watching 'Stay Close' On Netflix</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecCbmaispGKyrbHMnqWtmaKueqbCxKuwraCZo7RuwM5moqenp2Kuo7vUrWStoJVitarAjKamnKOlorKvwMCrsGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shad-gaspard-net-worth-71191.html><span>←</span><span>Shad Gaspard Net Worth</span></a>
