No one told me this part. There’s something about them, 11 years, 12 years later—the grief is still there. So at least I know. I do know that. And I think even without them telling me that, I feel that inside. I think they just confirmed that for me. I read somewhere that grief is love with no place to go, and I was like, ‘Huh…yeah…that does sum it up in some way.’”</p><img alt="regina king" title="regina king" width=1470 height=1838 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz040124-cover-lines-65f46902c49c6.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">LUIS ALBERTO RODRIGUEZ</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Elsewhere in the interview, King describes witnessing her son’s struggle with depression.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I feel like I am in a place now where my faith has really been challenged. … That idea that what you put into it is what you get back—it’s been proven to me that that’s not necessarily true,” she says. “When I look at all of the work and everything that we and Ian put into trying to move through the depression…I mean, he’s pure joy and pure light. … But he was struggling so much. We knew. We knew what we were going through, but he never presented that way. That’s why I know that a smile doesn’t always mean happy. He would never not let whoever he was with feel like they were the most special person in the world. So for me, I’m like, ‘Man, he was putting a lot into things, a lot into people, a lot into this world, and yet it wasn’t translating back.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you or someone you know is considering suicide, contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988, or go to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://988lifeline.org/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=988lifeline.org class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">988lifeline.org</a>.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
