Many have begun calling the combination a “super blue blood moon eclipse.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tuesday night and Wednesday morning there will be a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">total lunar eclipse</a>, which happens when the Earth passes between the sun and moon, blocking sunlight from reaching the moon. The lunar eclipse will occur at the same time as a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blue moon</a>, a term given to the second full moon of a given calendar month. And it will be considered by some a “supermoon,” or a full moon that’s closer to Earth than usual and can appear slightly brighter and larger than normal.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“A lot of things are happening at once,” Petro said. “It’s a cool event.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The last time this cosmic coincidence occurred was 35 years ago, according to Ernest Wright, a programmer in the Scientific Visualization Studio at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center. While some <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> say such a sky show hasn’t happened for more than 150 years, Wright and Fred Espenak, a famed eclipse expert and retired NASA astrophysicist, said the last total lunar eclipse during a super blue moon was on Dec. 30, 1982.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what else to know about the upcoming total lunar eclipse, supermoon and blue moon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/total-lunar-eclipse-picture.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What will we see during the total lunar eclipse?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Don’t be confused by the term “blue moon,” which has nothing to do with the color of the moon, scientists say. In fact, the full moon will appear red or a burnt-orange hue, which is where it gets its “blood moon” moniker. NASA says this happens because the indirect sunlight that reaches the moon, during a total lunar eclipse, first makes its way through the Earth’s atmosphere, where most of the scattered blue-colored light is filtered out. The moon could also appear blood red, dark brown or gray.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The exact shade will depend on global atmospheric conditions, like the amount of dust in Earth’s atmosphere, at the time of the total lunar eclipse. Petro says there’s a very small chance the total lunar eclipse during a blue moon could even appear to have a blue hue to it, but that would depend on a massive volcanic eruption happening beforehand. Particles in plumes of ash-clouds from such an eruption could scatter away red light, according to NASA.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Whether you’ll see the show also depends on local weather conditions, since cloud cover could partially or completely block the spectacle in some areas.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During a supermoon — like the one that took place Jan. 1 of this year, when the moon was closer to Earth than it will be for all of 2018 — the moon appears about 15% larger than usual and 30% brighter, Petro said. Some scientists only use the term supermoon to describe the single closest full moon in a 14-month cycle, but NASA uses the term more broadly to describe a full moon that occurs within 90% of the moon’s closest approach to Earth, according to Petro. (Because the moon’s orbit around Earth is elliptical, its distance from Earth is not fixed. Instead, it fluctuates between 225,600 miles and 252,100 miles, on average, according to Wright.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lunar-eclipse.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">When will we see the total lunar eclipse?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sky watchers on the West Coast and in the middle of the U.S. will have the best chance at catching the total lunar eclipse if they are early risers. Residents in Australia and Asia will get a “really good view” as well, Petro said. But people on the East Coast will have a less impressive view, since the lunar eclipse’s totality will occur as the sun is rising and moon is setting, Petro said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Overall, totality will last for about 1 hour and 16 minutes. Petro said it starts on the West Coast, including Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area, at about 4:51 a.m. PT and lasts until about 6:07 a.m. PT on Jan. 31. On the East Coast, including New York City, Boston and Washington D.C., the moon will be completely eclipsed starting at 7:51 a.m. ET.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">People willing to get up early, Petro said, will likely be rewarded for their efforts. “I hope the people who have the chance to see this eclipse really take it,” he said. “Go out and look at the night sky.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The lunar eclipse will be visible in other places besides the coasts. Residents in Mountain Time cities like Denver will get a decent look at the event starting at 5:51 a.m. The eclipse can also be seen above the U.S. border in Canada, where totality will begin in Toronto at the same time as American Eastern Time cities like New York. And the spectacle is not just limited to the Western Hemisphere. Most of India, for example, will see the phenomenon in totality between 5:18 p.m. and 6:21 p.m. local time.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Why does the moon turn red?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite the Earth fully covering the sun from the point of view of the moon, some light manages to pass through the planet’s atmosphere because it’s refracted by the Earth’s shadow, according to NASA. This light appears red due to a phenomenon known as rayleigh scattering.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“During a total lunar eclipse, white sunlight hitting the atmosphere on the sides of the Earth gets absorbed and then radiated out (scattered),” officials on NASA’s website wrote. “Blue-colored light is most affected. That is, the atmosphere filters out (scatters away) most of the blue-colored light. What’s left over is the orange- and red-colored light.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So, the “blood moon” moniker is not just for dramatic effect. It’s actually describing the remaining red light that’s shining onto the moon.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">When is the next total lunar eclipse?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The next total lunar eclipse can be seen on July 27, 2018 on several continents, including South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. The event will be visible again in America on Jan. 21, 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaGlqhHN9jpujrp1dorywuoytpq2ZnGK5trrAq2Sem5yevbSxjGtnanBf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./zoe-saldana-sequined-slipdress-jimmy-fallon-avatar.html><span>←</span><span>Zoe Saldaa Is a Vision in a Sequined Slipdress and Strappy Heels</span></a>
