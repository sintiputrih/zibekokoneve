She was linked with Matt Pilmoor. So, are they still together? The other intruders joining MAFS UK 2023 are Erica Roberts, Mark Kiley, Erica Roberts, Bianca Petronzi, and Sean Malkin.</p><p>Read all about her in this article here.</p><h3><strong>MAFS UK 2023: Are Matt Pilmoor And Adrienne Naylor Still Together?</strong></h3><p>The current relationship status of Matt Pilmoor and Adrienne Naylor is unclear. When the couple were linked the blonde bombshell said that she was surprised at being matched with Matt. Adrienne entered the show as an “intruder bride” over a couple of weeks.</p><p>Adrienne classes herself as “fiercely independent,” and after “having recently lost a life-changing eight stone, is full of a newfound confidence.”</p><p>A spokesman for Married at First Sight UK said: “Feeling she’s run out of dating options in rural Cumbria, Adrienne is on the hunt for a worthy man. Having left the family home at 15, she’s always been fiercely independent, but now is looking for someone equally self-driven she can share a future with. She now knows what she deserves and won’t settle for anything less. Having recently lost a life-changing eight stone, Adrienne is full of newfound confidence and ready to meet her perfect partner.”</p><p>Her partner Matt also opened up about joining the experiment. He told the Stray Ferret: “I went into the process not knowing what to expect but I gave it my best shot. Putting your trust in the experts knowing they will match you up with someone you want is a scary thought.”</p><p>Due to his late arrival on the show, Matt will be viewed as an “intruder groom”—a persona created to maybe attract attention as well as fall in love. He continued: “It was one of the most intense experiences of my life, but also one of the best, and a journey I’ll never forget. Expect lots of laughs, drama, and downfalls that get rebuilt through the show.”</p><h3><strong>Adrienne Naylor Age</strong></h3><p>In May 2023, Adrienne Naylor turned 27 years old.</p><h3><strong>Adrienne Naylor Parents</strong></h3><p>One of Adrienne Naylor’s parents is her mother Annie Banks.

She posts on social media asking followers to “invest in you” and then declares that “consistency is key” as she uploads pictures documenting her development from June 2017 to February 2023.</p><p>Adrienne later shared a photo of herself standing in a bikini on a yacht before getting her new look. She compared it to a photo of herself wearing black waistline leggings with a blue crop top pulled down to show off her impressive abs.</p><p>In her caption, Adrienne wrote: “Motivation for the week ahead, keep pushing. Going to be spending this year setting & achieving goals, Manifesting great things, and investing in myself.”</p><p>Back in 2021 documenting her weight loss journey, Adrienne said, “Haven’t posted progress for a while💫 Today was my 3rd check-in with <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@laurenpaigebrown_</a> So I’ve sat down and had some reflection time. I’m happy, content & FULL😂 6 & 1/2 stone down. I gained some Christmas beef, which I was struggling to get back off. Having such a bad relationship with food, I was either eating too little or bingeing. But having a little breather was so needed but feeling so proud of myself for being able to carry on after time off. It’s not a race 💖.”</p><h3><strong>Adrienne Naylor Job</strong></h3><p>Adrienne Naylor is working as a project support officer at the National Nuclear Laboratory.
