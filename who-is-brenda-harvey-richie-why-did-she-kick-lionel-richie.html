In 1988, Brenda unexpectedly showed up at Diane’s Beverly Hills home at 2 in the morning and found Lionel and Diane together.</span></p><p><span>According to Richie, who gave details to the police, Brenda kicked Richie in the stomach, turned over furniture, broke glasses, and caused a ruckus. When the police arrived, the situation was so terrible that Brenda had to be restrained on the ground while yelling for Diane.</span></p><p><span>Charges against Harvey included violence, trespassing, vandalism, causing bodily harm to her spouse, and resisting arrest. Brenda was released the following day after posting a $5,000 bond. After that contentious incident between him, Brenda, and his mistress, Lionel filed for divorce that same year, in 1988.
