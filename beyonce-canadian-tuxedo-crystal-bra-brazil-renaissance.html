She was showing love to the country she was visiting, as the fabulous all-denim ensemble comes from Brazilian-founded brand PatBO.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To keep the opulence going, Beyoncé paired the look with strappy, pointed-toe silver slingbacks by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theattico.com/en/shop/shoes/pumps/slingback-venus-silver-silver-248053047167399.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Attico" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>the Attico</u></a>, chunky silver hoop earrings by Jlani, and white-framed cat-eye sunglasses.
