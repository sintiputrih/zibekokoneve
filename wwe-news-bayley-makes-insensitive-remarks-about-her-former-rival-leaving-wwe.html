<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Bayley makes insensitive remarks about her former rival leaving WWE</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Bayley</strong> is one of the top female stars and currently leads her stable, Damage CTRL, on SmackDown. During her heel run in WWE, she once incurred a loss against former WWE superstar <strong>Kairi Sane</strong>. Although Sane defeated Bayley, it was her last match since she departed from the company after that.</p><p>Recently, a Twitter user posted a video of Kairi Sane‚Äôs last few moments in WWE following her match, to which the Damage CTRL leader replied. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bayley</a> retweeted the post and mocked the Japanese superstar. She said that Kairi‚Äôs departure is something that doesn‚Äôt matter, and nobody cares about it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The Role Model‚Äôs reply came to a fan page of WWE Women‚Äôs Wrestling, which revisited Kairi‚Äôs last match three years ago. After recalling this emotional moment from three years ago, Bayley hilariously trolled the former NXT star. She wrote, ‚ÄúWHO CARESü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£‚Äù and portrayed her insensitive side for the Pirate Princess.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>On the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">July 27, 2020, episode of Raw</a>, Kairi Sane, and Bayley competed in a singles match, which resulted in the former‚Äôs victory due to a roll-up pin. The shared video showed her last match and how the roster bid farewell to her. Moreover, she shared a special moment with her tag team partner, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Asuka</a>.</p><p>The Role Model‚Äôs heel persona has been a part of her WWE journey for four years and has blended into her successfully for now. She is barely seen breaking her kayfabe, even on social media, for the sake of her fandom. On the other hand, Kairi Sane‚Äôs time in the company saw her win the Women‚Äôs Tag Team Championship.</p><p>She also won the NXT Women‚Äôs Championship during her singles run. Kairi Sane has had quite a memorable time in NXT. On the other hand, Bayley is currently feuding with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shotzi</a> on the main roster. Her rivalry is speculated to be turning into a match between them at SummerSlam.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bayley reacts to hilarious blooper by Rhea Ripley‚Äôs alleged girlfriend at Money in the Bank</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kairi-sane-reacts-to-bayley-s-insensitive-message>Kairi Sane reacts to Bayley‚Äôs insensitive message</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-390-1024x576.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kairi Sane</a> left WWE in July 2020, which resulted in WWE making a video package to bid farewell to her. Her last match in the company came against Bayley, and she won the bout with a pinfall victory. But now, three years later, when the moment was revisited, the former SmackDown Champion disrespected her.</p><p>The negative remark by the Role Model caught the attention of Kairi Sane, and she reacted to it. She replied to Bayley‚Äôs tweet in a casual way by showing a gesture that laughed off the criticism. The Japanese superstar shared a GIF of herself smiling over Bayley‚Äôs negative remarks.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>She wrestled her last match in July 2020, even though her official contract ended in December 2021. Kairi bid adieu to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE</a> as she headed back to Japan for personal reasons. Being a fan favorite star in WWE, Sane was made their official brand ambassador in Japan. It would benefit the company to promote their product across the globe.</p><p><strong>In case you missed it:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK571rCcZqaVrMBursCyo56xXaKurLHSZqCnq5WjwKrAyK%2BcZqqVoq6zt9JmmJunpal6qbHRZp2oqp2av26%2ByK%2BYpWWcmq63tc2gZLCvlWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stella-gomez-html.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Stella Gomez - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
