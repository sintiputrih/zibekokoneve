Then the promoters of the entire tour went bankrupt. Bill looks at the ratings in TNA, and how poorly booked the company is, and he has no desire to put his legacy in their hands. He felt his run in WWE was bad enough. Letting Hogan, Bischoff, and Russo ruin his legacy any further just isn’t in his plans."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZVtbmltXZrFpLjUrKCvnV2stbp5xqijnZqVp7RusMidZKenpGLAqrPNZq6irJhiwa%2BtjLCpnqukobavsw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-wednesday-april-20.html><span>←</span><span>5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday, April 20</span></a>
