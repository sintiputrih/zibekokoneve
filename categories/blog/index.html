<a href=../../colin-in-black-and-white-jaden-michael-17-stars-as-kaepernick.html></a>
Teenage actor Jaden Michael was seen for the first time as an adolescent Colin Kaepernick on set of highly-anticipated Netflix limited series Colin In Black & White.
The 17-year-old star was seen Wednesday wearing a football jersey – presumably from Kaepernick’s middle school – on the California set of the show co-created by the controversial 33-year-old NFL star and Ava DuVernay.
Kaepernick ultimately became known for&nbsp;kneeling during the national anthem&nbsp;to protest police brutality and racial inequality at the start of NFL games during his time with the San Francisco 49ers.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Driver arrested, accused of hitting construction workers in Marietta while drunk</h2><time>Oct 9, 2024</time>
