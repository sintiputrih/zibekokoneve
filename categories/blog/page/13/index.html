<a href=../../../../stop-saving-the-rom-com-bros-html.html></a>
As an empty vessel of a genre, the romantic comedy is not worth resuscitating, though what it once contained probably is. There is almost as much romance in the movie Bros as there is talking about romantic comedies — two intersecting but separate concepts. On the side of the romance, there’s a tetchy courtship between Billy Eichner’s character, a never-been-in-a-relationship podcaster and LGBTQ-museum employee, and a masculine, never-going-to-respond-to-your-tap-on-Grindr lawyer played by Luke Macfarlane.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>A Very Murray Christmas Review</h2><time>Sep 18, 2024</time>

The singer, who was hosting the NBC show as well as performing as the musical guest, appeared to suffer a wardrobe malfunction as soon as she began singing the first single off her new album of the same name.
Grande, 22, started the number with a black jacket slung loosely around her shoulders, before dropping her arm and letting it slide off to one side.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Mike Josts biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story</h2><time>Sep 17, 2024</time>
