"I said to her, 'You have a drink on you? You have a car?' She said, 'Daddy, it's me–Tatum!' I was just trying to be funny with a strange Swedish woman, and it's my daughter. It's so sick."</p><p>Look back at Farrah Fawcett's unforgettable life</p><p>Tatum says she wasn't creeped out, either. "That's our relationship in a nutshell," says the actress, who won an Oscar at age 10 for starring with her father in Paper Moon. "You make of it what you will. It had been a few years since we'd seen each other, and he was always a ladies' man, a bon vivant."</p><p>See Us' photo tribute to stars gone too soon</p><p>Tatum had struggled with addiction growing up and hadn't spoken to her father in years. Penning her 2004 memoir A Paper Life didn't help their relationship, either.</p><p>See photos of your favorite child stars all grown up!</p><p>"She wrote a book–b***!" Ryan recalls thinking. "How dare she throw our laundry in the street for money!… Tatum says her father "has every right to be angry about the book; no parent wants to hear their kid saying s**** things about them… But what I wrote in the book was true. I've got a battle with drugs, but I'm a strong, independent person, and I fight for myself, and my father and I butt heads."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>See photos of your favorite child stars all grown up!</p><p>"When I was 16 years old, he and Farrah moved in together, and after that I saw my dad periodically, and that took a long time for me to get over," she says. "Would I do that to my kids? No, but I don't think Farrah was responsible for that. I truly thought Farrah was inspirational and beautiful and kind. Anyway, it's past; I've moved on. I'm older now, and I forgive him."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarsZGjerC6xJqjZqCZqXqwuoydmK6fmKmys3nTmquupV2WwW6ywKupmqBdm664r8Stq6xllqq7pr7ApWRraGBugHl7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mel-blanc-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Mel Blanc Net Worth 2024</span></a>
