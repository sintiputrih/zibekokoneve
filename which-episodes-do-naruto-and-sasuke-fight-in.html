The first time is on the hospital rooftop during episode 107, a fight that literally lasts for two episodes. This clash influences the rest of the events in the series and ultimately leads to their next fight, which begins in episode 128, “A Cry on Deaf Ears.” This is the iconic battle that takes place at the Valley of the End. It’s also the longest battle in the original Naruto series and runs until episode 135.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>The next time the two ninjas do battle is during Naruto Shippuden episode 215, which finishes in episode 216. We see a flashback of the pair doing battle as students in the Academy during episode 257. The flashbacks continue showing the pair doing battle during the original series until episode 260.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=false>Finally, the last battle between them takes place at the end of Naruto Shippuden beginning in episode 476 and going through episode 478.
