In front of virtually his whole family, the “Live Like You Were Dying” singer accepted this year’s ACM Icon Award.</p><p>McGraw attended the event and made an appearance on the red carpet alongside his wife Faith Hill and their two youngest daughters, Audrey and Maggie. They stunned the crowd by replicating their father’s white Dior suit and black, patterned Saint Laurent button-up attire for their very first red carpet appearance. As his family posed for photos, he gathered them and completed the shot with a black leather cowboy hat and black boots.</p><p>Audrey, 21, wore a flowing white Ascony dress, in contrast to her sister, 25, who wore a form-fitting black outfit. Hill completed the stylish foursome in a long-sleeved black Valentino minidress with a ruffled capelet and cuffs and glittering knee-high boots.</p><p>Wednesday saw the third straight Carly Pearce-hosted ACM Honours at Nashville, Tennessee’s Ryman Auditorium. Clint Black, Randy Travis, Mary Chapin Carpenter, and Charlie Daniels, who are all regarded as members of the country music elite, were also honored that evening.</p><p>A performer whose body of work has profoundly influenced pop music on a global level is given the Icon Award.</p><p>When ET spoke with the 56-year-old after the Standing Room Only Tour was announced last month, he joked that he was “the worst singer” in his family. He said that Gracie, Maggie, and Audrey were all good singers in general. “I’d love to record a song with the five of us at some point. Every time I bring it up, they respond, “I ain’t gonna sing with you, Dad.”</p><p>Maybe I’ll convince them to do it. Maybe they’ll get to the point where they’re a little less reluctant to sing along with me. They’ll sing with Mom even if I’m probably not up to par with the rest of them’, he said. “I’m the worst vocalist in the family. It is actual. I have a great voice, but I’m not the best singer in the family.</p><p>Maybe one day the artist will attend the ACMs to watch one of his daughters win the Icon Award! When asked if his wife will join him on tour for some concerts, McGraw replied that Hill “comes out occasionally and hangs out with us.”</p><p>He said of his more than 26-year-old wife, “She likes it. By the stage, she is having fun. If we had a camera on her, she would be dancing all night.</p><p>McGraw gave fans a glimpse of the incredible tour that Pearce will be opening for him in addition to letting them see Hill in the background.</p><p>We haven’t played an arena tour in a long. I’m looking forward to it. I can’t wait for everyone to see our upcoming wild and spectacular production. This is definitely the most unique production we’ve ever seen. Before adding that there probably won’t be any pyrotechnic displays during his performance, he said, “We’re going to blow it out.</p><p>I don’t do much pyro. I’m incredibly afraid. When one of those things goes off, I’ll be standing right over it because I move all over the place, I know myself well enough to know,” McGraw humorously remarked. We don’t need that, sorry. My a** would start burning. On Monday, September 18, Fox will broadcast the 2023 Academy of Country Music Honours.</p><p><strong>Also Read :</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtorJmieq6vxquYsGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-best-thanksgiving-songs-for-kids.html><span>←</span><span>The best Thanksgiving songs for kids</span></a>
