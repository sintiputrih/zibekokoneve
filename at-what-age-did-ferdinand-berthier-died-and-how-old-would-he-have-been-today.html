After school, young Ferdinand came from the rural southeast of France to learn basic vocational skills and literacy to prepare him for work as a tradesman. Berthier was influenced by his teacher Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian. By the age of 27 Berthier had become one of the more senior professors at the school.</p><p>Ferdinand petitioned the French government for permission to create the&nbsp;Société Centrale des Sourds-muets in 1837. This was officially founded the following year as the first organisation to represent the interests of the deaf community. Berthier played a delicate balancing act as a passionate defender of the deaf identity and&nbsp;sign language, while under a repressive social and political climate.</p><p>In his personal life, there is currently no information on Ferdinand Berthier’s marital life. It is not known if he also had any children. Perhaps he kept it away from the public or he never married at all.</p><p>Berthier wrote books about deaf history and deaf culture, noting deaf artists and sign-language poets of his time. He died on 12 July 1886 in Paris, aged 82.</p><h3><strong>Google Doodle Celebrates Ferdinand Berthier</strong></h3><p>On September 30, 2023, Google celebrated its 220th birthday with a Google Doodle.
