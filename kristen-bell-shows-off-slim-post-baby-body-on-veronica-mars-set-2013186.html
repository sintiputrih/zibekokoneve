<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Kristen Bell Shows Off Slim Post-Baby Body on Veronica Mars Set</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong><a href=#>Kristen Bell</a></strong> is back to business. Less than three months after <a href=#>giving birth</a> to daughter <strong>Lincoln</strong> (with fiance <a href=#><strong>Dax Shepard</strong></a>), the 32-year-old actress reported for her first day of work on the Veronica Mars movie June 17. Bell shared a picture of her slim post-baby body via her official <a href=#>Twitter</a> account. "A break on the Veronica Mars movie set for me," she wrote in the caption. "So obviously, I'm trying out this weighted hula hoop." The picture shows a beaming Bell wearing a sleeveless, cleavage-baring black top,&nbsp; as well as skinny jeans and black boots.</p><p>Nearly 92,000 fans funded the Veronica Mars Kickstarter campaign, raising more than $5 million in a month. The cult TV series was canceled after three seasons in 2007.</p><p>"I feel f-cking great," Bell told <a href=#>Indie Wire</a> before filming began. "I'm also not responsible for all the prep work, so it's easy for me. I love the script, and I'm so excited to see everyone again. Working with my old friends and working on this project is going to be the perfect summer experience."</p><p>The Veronica Mars movie will feature many familiar faces, including <strong>Ryan Hansen</strong>, <strong>Krysten</strong> <strong>Ritter</strong>, <strong>Tina Majorino</strong>, <strong>Chris Lowell</strong>, <strong>Francis</strong> <strong>Capra</strong>, <strong>Jason Dohring</strong>, <strong>Enrico</strong> <strong>Colantoni</strong>, <strong>Percy Daggs III</strong>, <strong>Daran Norris</strong>, <strong>Amanda</strong> <strong>Noret</strong>, <strong>Brandon Hillock</strong>, <strong>Kevin</strong> <strong>Sheridan</strong> and <strong>Jonathan</strong> <strong>Chesner</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>2013 has been a big year for Bell — and not just because she gets to reunite with her former costars on the big screen. During a June 3 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the Michigan native opened up about what life has been like since Lincoln's March 28 birth. "It's actually better than I expected," Bell said of motherhood. "It's pretty wonderful."</p><p>Bell added that Parenthood's Shepard, 38, is "the best" dad. "It's like he's just made a new best friend," she explained. "He just talks to her all the time. And sings to her all day. It's wonderful."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKroaOpsq95wZ6jpWWjnby4v4yonZ9lo6G2rnnPqKqtZZKWr7p5waibsmWfo3q3sdGopaKbkWK6or7SZqqerF1nfXJ%2FkHFtaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kayte-christensen-net-worth-2021-age-wikipedia-biography-height-family.html><span>←</span><span>Kayte Christensen Net Worth, Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Height, Family</span></a>
