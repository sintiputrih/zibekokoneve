Ruffalo ultimaltey waited until their daughter was a week old to share the scary news with his wife, Sunrise Coigney.</p><p>“When I told Sunny about it, first she thought I was joking,” he said, explaining how his wife was in disbelief. “And then she just burst into tears and said, ‘I always knew you were gonna die young.”</p><p>Ruffalo also revealed what pushed him to get tested for a brain tumor, and it wasn’t symptoms like some people may expect. Rather, the actor admits he had a dream that told him about the tumor, pushing him to get it looked after.</p><p>“I had one of those 4 a.m. calls and I woke up probably around 3 a.m. and I just had this crazy dream,” Mark explained. “And it wasn’t like any other dream I’d ever had. It was just like, ‘You have a brain tumor.’ It wasn’t even a voice. It was just pure knowledge, ‘You have a brain tumor, and you have to deal with it immediately.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ruffalo-rsquo-s-tumor-left-him-permanently-deaf-in-one-ear>Ruffalo’s Tumor Left Him Permanently Deaf In One Ear<img alt="Mark Ruffalo and wife Sunrise " data-image-id=251007 data-mobile-optimized=true height=614 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screen-shot-2024-01-25-at-2-13-16-pm.png width=808 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p>The actor said that the only symptom he had was an ear infection, though he hadn’t connected the dots it could be a tumor. Still, after the prophetic dream, Ruffalo went to the doctor and insisted they test him to figure out if something was indeed wrong.</p><p>“I said ‘Listen, this is going to sound crazy, but I had this dream last night that I had a brain tumor,’” he explained, saying his doctor even had a CAT scan done despite there being no evidence a the time to suggest it was a tumor. “And I was like, ‘Great, I am crazy. Just do it anyway.’”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screen-shot-2024-01-25-at-2-13-16-pm.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Mark Ruffalo Almost Passed On His Iconic '13 Going On 30' Role">Mark Ruffalo Almost Passed On His Iconic '13 Going On 30' Role</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>'13 Going on 30' is one of the most iconic 2000s rom-com, so what made Mark Ruffalo nearly turn down the role?</p><p>He recalls the doctor being surprised when something did eventually turn up on the scan, saying, “She comes in and she’s just kind of, like, a zombie. And she says, ‘You have a mass behind your left ear the size of a golf ball.
