Its head and tail are of equal width. Researchers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">believe</a> that the bird’s tail was enlarged by its creator to prevent it from tipping forward when placed on a surface.</p><p>The artifact’s original details have been otherwise obscured by time, but researchers have been able to identify subtle markings where the bird’s eyes and beak would have been carved.</p><p>Researchers also noted that the bird was likely carved from a mammal’s limb and that it was colored by a type of controlled heating process which also worked to shape and shrink the bone.</p><p>All in all, the discovery suggests that people in Eastern Asia invented their own sophisticated art forms. According to the study, which was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> in the journal PLOS One, it may be “the first known instance of an original artistic tradition.”</p><p>The analysis ultimately pushes back the representation of birds in Chinese art by 8,500 years.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-283658 alt="Chinese Hwamei" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/chinese-hwamei.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-283658 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Researchers believe the sculpture is of a passerine bird, like this one pictured here.</span></p><p>The Lingjing archaeological site has been under excavation since 2005 and is overseen by lead researcher Li Zhanyang and has uncovered other intriguing artifacts, including an ostrich egg pendant, pieces of broken pottery, and a host of sharpened tools which may have been used in constructing the small bird.</p><p>Even though much older figurines have been discovered before this in Europe, this particular figurine remains a significant step in understanding the origins of prehistoric sculpting in other parts of the world.</p><p>The figurine is so far the only 3D Stone Age object of its kind in East Asia. “It is also the only Palaeolithic carving for which, thanks to its exceptional state of preservation, the final stages of manufacture could be documented in detail.”</p><p>Next up, find out about a collection of <a href=#>ancient “unknown” human skulls</a> that were discovered in China.
