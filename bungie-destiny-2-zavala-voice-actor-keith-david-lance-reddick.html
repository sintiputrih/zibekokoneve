He was 60. As Zavala, he’d been with Destiny players from the beginning, serving as the Titan Vanguard. For many longtime Destiny players (Titan-class players in particular), Reddick was a daily presence in their gaming lives for nearly a decade. Zavala is crucial to the story of Destiny, and an ever-present figure in the Tower.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbvLsp6opl6YvK57kWxva29ja4RwrtSnnqKdXZmytMDIp7Bmal2vrrety5pkr6eZmLJurcKtpqtlm5q2tbSMnZivoZRiuaK6wp5kq52Umbaktw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-deals.html><span>←</span><span>AnandTech | Best Deals</span></a>
