As he grew up in the cities of Chicago and Cleveland, he witnessed and experienced life with an abusive father, who eventually ended up in jail for manslaughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, Howard appeared to have <a href=#>followed in his old man’s footsteps</a> in some ways, with claims of assault levied against him on several occasions.</p><h2 id=what-was-terrence-howard-rsquo-s-life-like-before-fame><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>What Was Terrence Howard’s Life Like Before Fame?</span></h2><p>In a way, Terrence Howard’s life always revolved around acting and fame. He is the great-grandson of Hollywood and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadway star Minnie Gentry</a>, and she actually raised him after his parents divorced in light of his father’s incarceration.</p><p>Despite this connection, it wasn’t until he was in his 20s that Howard started acting on a professional level.</p><h2 id=terrence-howard-rsquo-s-early-career-roles><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Terrence Howard’s Early Career Roles</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Terrence Howard got his start on the silver screen playing Jackson 5 founding member Jackie Jackson in the ABC miniseries The Jacksons: An American Dream of 1992.

The film was set to be directed by Jon Favreau, and would become the very first installment in the <strong><a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a></strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He did indeed play the character James "Rhodey" Rhodes in the movie, but he was seemingly fired from the franchise, and replaced by Don Cheadle.

Among other factors, that salary arguably makes that job the biggest of his 30-year-long career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Terrence Howard Still Mad About Being Fired From The MCU?</a></span></p><h2 id=terrence-howard-announced-he-was-retiring-in-2019><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Terrence Howard Announced He Was Retiring In 2019</span></h2><p>As Empire neared the end of its five-year run on Fox, Terrence Howard made the stunning revelation that the role would be the final one of his career.
