In general, there are a lot of different TikTok "houses" that have aided most influencers in rebranding their content and landing major deals, but out of this large number, <a href=#>the TikTok Hype House has repeatedly been at the top</a> for a while now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now listed on <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>, the docu-series follows the lives of a group of TikTok influencers and shows the world the hard work done behind the scenes to create the videos that have us on TikTok all day. Sited in L.A.and established in December 2019 shortly after the rise of the app, the Hype House started in a huge Spanish-style building that gave a view of the entire community. However, in June 2020, the group moved to a new location in Hollywood Hills after some complications, and as all the previous Hype House gang have repeatedly shown, they don’t exactly take their luxuries lightly and this was proven by their new place. The new house is a 12,000-square foot estate with all the luxury facilities you can think of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same way, their location changed, so did the content they put out and some of their members. At its peak, the house had 21 members but now, most of them have moved into their places. As expected of people with such high taste in luxury, these stars are doing pretty well for themselves and making amounts considered above decent. Here are the richest cast members in the new series.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s TikTok Twin Goes Viral</a></span></p><h2 id=chase-hudson-39-s-net-worth-is-3-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Chase Hudson's Net Worth Is $3 Million</span></h2><p>Also known as Lil Huddy, Chase Hudson is largely known as the influencer who dated TikTok icon, Charli D'Amelio.
