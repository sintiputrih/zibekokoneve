I love this movie. So if that happens again, that would be amazing.”</p><p>Sandler and his wife,<strong> Jackie Sandler</strong>, welcomed Sadie and Sunny in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and the little ones have already taken an interest in following in his footsteps.</p><p><a href=#>“They like [acting],”</a> the comedian told Us exclusively earlier this month. “They like watching it, and they like talking about acting. But we’ll see. They’re still little kids, but they both like watching films. They like comedy, serious stuff, Stranger Things. … They’re funny kids. I just know that they have a good time. They like doing it around the house.”</p><p>His daughters are also <a href=#>interested in music</a>, the<a href=#> Saturday Night Live </a>alum shared with Us in October. “Both my daughters come on stage and sing sometimes because they’re on the road with me all the time,” he said at the time. “They like to sing … and they see Daddy up there and they’re like, ‘Can I try that?’ So I say, ‘Get on up there.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Adam-Sandler-Filming-Uncut-Gems-Adam-Sandler-CantLet-His-Daughters-Watch-Uncut-Gems-Because-They-Would-Be-Disappointed-02.jpg><p>For more information on the Happy Madison Productions creator’s home life with Sunny and Sadie, check out the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.</p><p>With reporting by Nicole Pajer</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaanJGierStzZ2jnqpdnnqkrc2tZKWdpGK6unnDmqygoKSav7R51pqrnKBdqrukwdNmnp6lo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./small-earthquake-shakes-new-york-city-prompting-reports-explosions.html><span>←</span><span>Small earthquake shakes New York City, prompting reports of explosions WSOC TV</span></a>
