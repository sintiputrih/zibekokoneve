This is the time of year where chili contests abound and everyone wants to claim the coveted prize. If you want a prize-winning chili, I have a winner for you! This </span><b>MJ’s Award-Winning Beef Chili</b><span> is no joke. I can’t guarantee you will take home the big prize but I can guarantee that you will LOVE this chili. Thank you </span><span>BUSH’s slow-simmered chili beans and Hunt’s vine-ripened tomatoes</span><span> for sponsoring this post.</span></p><p><span>There are all kinds of theories out there as to what kind of chili reigns supreme. Beans or no beans? I always go with beans. It makes the chili hearty and filling. &nbsp;Ground beef or chuck roast beef? I love both of them and use them both in my chili recipes (</span><a href=#><b>Texas Sized Chili Bar</b></a><span>). This MJ’s Award-Winning Chili uses chuck roast because it becomes so tender when braised slowly. It’s downright heavenly!</span></p><p><span>The key to making a perfect chili is the combination of flavors from the tender beef, </span><a href=#><span>seasoned BUSH’s chili beans, Hunt’s fire-roasted diced tomatoes</span></a><span>, broth, and warm spices. It is all about layers upon layers of flavors. I like to cook my chili low and slow — either in a dutch oven pot or in a slow cooker. This ensures that the flavors come together in the </span><b>ultimate pot of chili</b><span>.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MJs-Award-Winning-Chili-3.jpg alt="MJ's Award-Winning Chili is made with tender beef chuck roast simmered to perfection, onions, peppers, chili beans, fire-roasted tomatoes, and mexican spices. A perfect prize-winning chili recipe. www.modernhoney.com" width=4502 height=3948 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>I have</span><b> a little secret ingredient up my sleeve</b><span> in my chili recipes and that is Dr. Pepper! You can use Coke as well but it is a match made in heaven with beef and helps to tenderize it so it just melts in your mouth.</span></p><p><span>So what </span><b>spices</b><span> do you use to make this killer MJ’s Award-Winning Beef Chili? The numero uno spice to use is chili powder. This is what gives it that earthy depth of flavor and mild spice. &nbsp;You can use a traditional chili powder, an ancho chili powder, or even a New Mexico chili powder. There are many choices! I love to use half traditional chili powder and half ancho chili powder. Cumin is another powerhouse spice as it gives a lot of bang for the buck…a little bit goes a long way. &nbsp;A touch of cayenne pepper gives it a little kick. A pinch of cinnamon brings in some warmth.</span></p><p><span>This MJ’s Award-Winning Chili calls for chuck roast, cut into bite-size pieces. I am a huge fan of chuck roast as it has enough fat on it to make it tender without it being too much. It has such amazing texture. &nbsp;The key is to brown the beef. Why is it important to do this extra step? Well, it brings out the flavor in the meat. &nbsp;I sauté it in a little bit of oil to give it a nice brown crust. I sauté the beef with some chopped onion to elevate the flavors.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Chilies-and-Cilantro.jpg alt="MJ's Award-Winning Beef Chili uses a combination of onions and chilies to give it a depth of flavor. www.modernhoney.com" width=2698 height=2015 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>A combination of sautéed onions and peppers is vital to developing flavors in the chili. I love using diced onions, jalapenos, and a red pepper. You can even throw in a poblano pepper for a mild heat.</span></p><p><b>Beans are one important component in chili</b><span>, in my opinion. I always reach for BUSH’s chili beans because they make it so easy for me. Their chili beans are covered in a mild chili sauce, which makes the beans taste even better. I like to use a combination of chili beans — pinto, kidney, and white. It keeps people on their toes and makes things interesting!</span></p><p><span>I am throwing in an option for you. &nbsp;Many people swear by adding masa, which is corn flour, into their chili. It acts as a thickening agent and adds richness to the chili. &nbsp;If you don’t have masa, you can use 1 cup of cheddar or pepper jack cheese to give the chili a little creaminess.</span></p><p><b>The toppings are essential</b><span>! Some of my favorite chili toppings are shredded Mexican cheese, sour cream, cilantro, avocado, green onions, tortilla strips, and even jalapeno if you like to keep things spicy. &nbsp;I love to put out a toppings bar like this one — </span><a href=#><b>Texas Sized Chili Bar</b></a><b>. </b><span>This is so fun for parties!</span></p><p><span>This MJ’s Award-Winning Beef Chili can be made on the stovetop or in a slow cooker/crockpot. The key is low and slow with the beef so a slow cooker works like a charm. Always add your beans more at the end of cooking time though. They just need some time to heat up.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/MJs-Award-Winning-Chili-7.jpg alt="MJ's Award-Winning Chili is made with tender beef chuck roast simmered to perfection, onions, peppers, chili beans, fire-roasted tomatoes, and mexican spices.
