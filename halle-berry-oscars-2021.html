It's not the first time Berry has worn short hair to the Oscars.

She made history as the first Black woman to win Best Actress back in 2002—for her role in Monster's Ball—while wearing her iconic pixie cut. This year's bob look is a little longer but just as memorable. She teased a major hair change ahead of the red carpet, sharing a snap of hair on the floor presumably after a cut.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I am my best self when I have super short hair. That’s when I feel most like me and most confident," Berry told the Huffington Post back in 2012. "Growing up as a black woman, I felt that if I didn’t have long hair, I wasn’t going to be beautiful. I always thought that. Cutting my hair was freeing."</p><img alt="93rd annual academy awards arrivals" title="93rd Annual Academy Awards - Arrivals" width=1024 height=696 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/halle-berry-attends-the-93rd-annual-academy-awards-at-union-news-photo-1619396026.?resize=640:*" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Pool</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She paired the new haircut with an equally bold look: a custom Dolce & Gabbana dress in a shade of magenta. The oversized bow, plunging neckline, and flowing fabric made for some incredible red carpet images. Berry paired her new haircut with fresh, glowing makeup in similar shades of pinky nudes and mauves. Her hair color, too, helped highlight the cut's sharp angles with streaks of soft golden and caramel color.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don't really give over to trends and beauty fads, and I'm not one to jump on the bandwagon," Berry told Popsugar earlier this year. "I've worked really hard to stay myself through all of this that's going on and to stay true to what I think beauty is so that I can feel my best self."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xX6GutbHSrWaaa2ZnfXF%2FkmxmoZmcobJursSrqbJln6iwor7SZmlpamFk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./citizen-way.html><span>←</span><span>Bulletproof by Citizen Way | MultiTracks.com</span></a>
