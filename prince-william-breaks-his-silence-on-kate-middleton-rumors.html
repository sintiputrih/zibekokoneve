He has subtly addressed Kate’s health during a number of appearances, including when he <a href=#>apologized for her absence</a> at the 2024 British Academy Film Awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Prince-William-breaks-silence-on-Kate-02.jpg><p>“I’m sorry Catherine’s not here. She does love the BAFTAs,” the Prince of Wales said at the February 18 awards show.</p><p>Earlier this month, William thanked students for <a href=#>presenting him with gifts</a> for Kate during a visit to a Welsh elementary school. Later that day, he <a href=#>did not respond</a> when asked about Kate’s condition while arriving for an appearance at Wrexham AFC Stadium on March 1.</p><p>Kate was <a href=#>spotted for the first time</a> since her surgery on Monday, March 4. In photos obtained by <a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a>, she was wearing sunglasses while riding in a car with her mother, <strong>Carole Middleton</strong>. She had not been seen publicly since December 2023.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>News about Kate’s surgery coincided with the announcement that <strong>King Charles III</strong> would undergo a procedure for an <a href=#>enlarged prostate</a>. Unlike Kate, Charles, 75, has shared details regarding his health with the public, revealing in February that he had been diagnosed with an <a href=#>undisclosed form of cancer</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Prince-William-breaks-silence-on-Kate.jpg><p>“Simply because one patient is comfortable discussing their health in a certain way does not mean both patients should be,” royal expert <strong>Gareth Russell</strong> exclusively told <a href=#>Us</a> last month about Kate and Charles’ different approaches. “Just stepping back from the royal aspect of things for a moment, patient privacy is still a really important and a fundamental right.”</p><p>He continued: “Sometimes when you are a patient, even if you have the ability to raise awareness, you are still maybe processing some of this yourself. Maybe you want to take it at your own timetable.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ51qKjpaGRonqjvsSaoqxlmJ7Abr%2FIpZynm5VivK95ypqrnmWdnrGluMStpqdloqq6sL7SaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./prettygarden-floral-bodycon-midi-dress-amazon.html><span>←</span><span>Prettygarden Floral Bodycon Dress Is Seriously Figure-Flattering</span></a>
