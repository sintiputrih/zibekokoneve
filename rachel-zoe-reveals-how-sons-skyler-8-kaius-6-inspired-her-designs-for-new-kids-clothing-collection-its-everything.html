What’s not surprising is the fact that she’s inspired just by being a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mom</a>. “I have a lot of little muses in my life, especially Skyler and Kaius,” Rachel told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>EXCLUSIVELY at a party celebrating the launch of her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rachel Zoe X Janie & Jack Exclusive Party Collection</a> at The Grove in Los Angeles on Nov. 21. “The collection is true to all the things I love like metallics, luxe fabrics and sparkle. All of those design elements are what inspires my ready-to-wear collection and really my approach to this line was the same. I wanted to create clothes that children would be excited to wear because they felt special but comfortable.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The line offers both girls & boys options between $18-$169, perfect for any mom as they prepare to dress their little ones going into the most wonderful time of the year. Seeing as Rachel’s sons inspired her to start this, it’s absolutely no surprise to see them modeling in the campaign. “<span lang=en>I</span><span lang=en>t is everything!” Rachel said of seeing the ads starring her boys. “I love that they were able to be a part of this experience. It was definitely a surreal moment to be on set with them and all the other little models and actually see the clothes come to life!”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>For Rachel, it was an easy choice to partner with this particular kids retailer since it’s a place she’s grown so familiar with over the years as she checks another dream off her ever growing bucket list. “I have shopped at Janie and Jack for my boys long before this collaboration came to life, so it was a dream come true to partner with their team,” Rachel said adding that her kids even had a hand in helping with the designs. “<span lang=en>My kids are my biggest inspiration so in a way, yes! They were so excited by this entire process, and that I was designing something especially for them. Skyler is at the age where he is starting to give feedback on what he wants to wear,&nbsp;</span><span lang=en>so I had to make sure this collection was comfortable and not too restrictive.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH5ze5FpZquZk52yrXnZqJxmqpWrsqK40mafqK9dqLyvv4ysorKklad6eXnKmqCuq11reqq60qmgq52UYrWmvoydnKyhl6PAbrLOq2SnnadiuKqw0maapaeknbavs4ycpqWklZjBqrvNZqCtq12aw6a%2B2K2foqaXZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brian-ngo-bio-girlfriend-height-family-love-is-blind.html><span>←</span><span>Meet Love Is Blind's Brian Ngo!
