The Hollywood Game Night host added: “There’s nothing she needs, she has everything I’m sure [of] that."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

In attendance from the hit Fox series were costars and close pals<a href=#><strong> Becca Tobin</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Darren Criss</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jonathan Groff</strong></a>. Show creator <a href=#><strong>Ryan Murphy</strong> </a><a href=#>officiated the nuptials</a>.</p><p>The show, which recently celebrated its 10th anniversary, also starred <a href=#><strong>Matthew Morrison</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kevin McHale</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Naya Rivera</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Amber Riley</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Heather Morris</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Chord Overstreet</strong></a> and the late <a href=#>Mark Salling</a> and <a href=#>Cory Monteith</a>. (Michele was <a href=#>dating Monteith when he died</a> at age 31 in July 2013.)</p><p>Lynch, who played gym teacher Sue Sylvester,<a href=#> reflected on the coming-of -age show last month</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Jane-Lynch-wedding-gift.jpg><p>“What I miss most of all is the message and how every kid who watched that show – including adults in some situations – had some character that they deeply identified with,” she told Us. “I think that’s why it moved people so much. Those issues were spoken to through music, and music moves.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Lynch didn’t make an appearance at the celebration, she’s been busy launching Banfield’s new telehealth tool, <a href=#>Vet Chat</a>, helping to encourage pet owners to “Nix the Net, Text a Vet.” The technology allows wellness plan clients to use the platform to message a professional vet with questions about their pets, instead of searching the symptoms on the internet.</p><p>“Because what a lot of people do, and I know I do this, is that you go online and you look up your dog’s symptoms. And it’s anywhere from cancer to ‘don’t worry about it,'” she told Us. “So why not just text a vet? And it’s part of your optimum wellness program with Banfield Pet Hospital.”</p><p>With reporting by Travis Cronin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ6aeq3FzZyfZq%2BYrnqqecOim6esXZy2t7GMpZyaZZ2esKmxy55kmmWnmrGltc2gZKChlql8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eva-longoria-desperate-housewives-wouldnt-work-today-canceled.html><span>←</span><span>Eva Longoria Says 'Desperate Housewives'Would Get &amp;quot;Canceled&amp;quot; Today</span></a>
