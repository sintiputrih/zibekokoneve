The Challenge: USA, as well as UK, Argentinian, and Australian versions of The Challenge (the latter three aired on other networks) all played out between the summer of 2022 through February. That led to The Challenge: World Championship, a season linking all four spin-off shows. It streamed on Paramount Plus from March through mid-May and featured stars from all international iterations as well as a group of MTV’s challengers.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>The Challenge: USA was unique as only reality stars from four CBS reality shows — Survivor, The Amazing Race, Love Island, and Big Brother — starred in it. Episodes dropped weekly from July 6 to Sept. 14, 2022, and Survivors’ Sarah Lacina and Danny McCray became Challenge champions and walked away with around $250,000 apiece.</p><h2 id=h-when-is-cbs-airing-its-second-season-of-the-challenge data-injectable=false>When is CBS airing its second season of The Challenge?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>Although the World Championship season has played out, CBS has elected to remain in business with The Challenge. The USA’s version is releasing its second season, and it’ll premiere on the network on August 10. It’s slated to stream on Paramount Plus as well.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=651 data-injectable=true>USA 2 will feature contestants from three CBS staples — Survivor, Big Brother, and The Amazing Race. And for the first time ever, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">notable names from MTV’s version of The Challenge will cross over to CBS</a>. Specifically, John “Johnny Bananas” Devenanzio, Jonna Stephens, Amanda Garcia, Tori Deal, Cory Wharton, and Wes Bergmann, will carry MTV’s flag.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>That means 18 CBS contestants will contend with the series’ veterans, including two from The Amazing Race, seven from Survivor, and nine from Big Brother (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">check out the full cast list here</a>).</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=false>On the MTV side of things, the last mainline season that aired was Ride or Dies, the 38th iteration. It ran from October to March. Although nothing has been announced pertaining to it, MTV renewed The Challenge for its 39th season back in June 2022, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tNhmoKxlpJ2ybq%2FHmqOlnZ6csm67zWaam6tdo7y4ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./devin-ratray-girlfriend-accusation-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Home Alone Star Devin Ratray?
