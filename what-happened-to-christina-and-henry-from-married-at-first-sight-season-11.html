Henry, who was a 35-year-old healthcare worker at the time, also accused Christina of being homeless, as most of her possessions appeared to be in storage.</p><p>Needless to say, when Decision Day arrived, the couple ultimately went their separate ways and divorced.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Season 11 of Lifetime’s <a href=#>Married At First Sight</a>, aired in 2020, but where are Christina and Henry now?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-christina-moved-to-mexico-to-work-remotely>Christina moved to Mexico to work remotely</h2><p>Since her time on Married At First Sight, Christina Crochet has largely gone off the radar.
