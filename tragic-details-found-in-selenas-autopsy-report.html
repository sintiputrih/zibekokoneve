Originally a devout fan,&nbsp;<a href=#>Esquire</a>&nbsp;reported that&nbsp;Saldivar ultimately was brought on board to head up the singer's fan club and oversaw thousands of dollars worth of transactions and merchandise along with other activities. It soon became apparent to Selena and her family that the head of her own fan club was stealing from her, leaving her no choice but to terminate all personal and professional ties with the woman she once trusted and called a friend. Saldivar was also managing several boutiques that Selena owned throughout southern Texas.</p><p>According to <a href=#>All&nbsp;That's Interesting</a>, members of the singer's fan club had submitted a barrage of complaints that led to certain suspicions about Yolanda Saldivar's activities within the business structure; suspicions that ultimately unveiled unsavory truths about embezzlement and fraud on&nbsp;Saldivar's part.&nbsp;After declaring her unfit for employment, Selena agreed to meet her former friend and business associate at a Days Inn located in Corpus Christi, Texas in order to obtain certain business documents that she still had in her possession and to tie up any other loose ends. Unfortunately, the Tejano singer wouldn't return from the meeting alive. In a fit of rage, Yolanda Saldivar produced a revolver and fatally shot Selena before engaging in a nine-hour standoff with authorities called to the scene of the killing. She was eventually subdued, apprehended, and taken into custody (per Esquire).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFkGlpcWpfqb%2Bis8icZJ2dpJa2rb%2BMn6auppRitq950p6jnqaRqHqiwdOop6yxXaeysbvRrWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./renee-satterthwaite.html><span>←</span><span>Renee Satterthwaite</span></a>
