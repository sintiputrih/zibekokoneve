Raylan (Timothy Olyphant), in one of his more genuine scenes, came clean to Art (Nick Searcy) about the tarmac incident. Elsewhere, Ava (Joelle Carter) was set up by her cellmate and a rejected male prison guard (clearly suffering from a severe case of the Napoleon complex), and Johnny (David Meunier) set the stage for a new form of hostile takeover by being one step ahead of everyone else. Then, the credits rolled and viewers were left contemplating the fallout to come.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=314 data-injectable=false>In the first promising move since the Crowes took up residence in Harlan County, they managed to make a friend. After trying to antagonize Boyd into coughing up cash and essentially throwing themselves into the thick of it by kidnapping one his men, they finally managed to be in the right place at the right time.</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=742 data-injectable=true>Boyd is in the midst of several calamities at the moment. He’s dealing with the repercussions of&nbsp; the Detroit/Canada situation, he has Johnny moving in with a revenge plot that is smart enough to cause him some sleepless nights, and his “wife” has been semi-permanently retained by the correctional system pending trial, with her stay recently extended. The eye of the storm has most definitely passed, folks.</p><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>He continues to be an elusive character, though. His ability to appear decidedly calm regardless of the exigent matters loaded on his plate like Jenga blocks makes him hard to read, even for Raylan at times. It also makes Boyd somewhat terrifying. Couple it with his penchant for a wicked tongue and you’ve got yourself a serious outlaw contender.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>Justified adds to his reign this week by introducing a novel concept – instead of him going to war with the Crowes on top of everything else hitting the fan, why not add them to his circle? That’s several less people gunning for him and several more people pointing guns on his behalf. It’s brilliant, and only marginally predictable.</p><p data-characters=36 data-current-count=36 data-injectable=false><i>Continue reading on the next page…</i></p>Pages: <span class="post-page-numbers current" aria-current=page>1</span> <a href=# class=post-page-numbers>2</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yrwdKtoJ%2BhlZl6s7HVopywZZueua15zJ6qrJ2enLKzedKemKynnmKCbrHPoqqonJVig3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./derek-watts-cause-of-death.html><span>←</span><span>Derek Watts Cause Of Death, Age, Funeral, Net Worth</span></a>
