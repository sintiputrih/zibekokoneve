Who else out there is with me?”</p><p>With that being said, the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Real Housewives of Beverly Hills </a>star has since colored her hair blonde and even pink.</p><p>Then there’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a>, who has been very outspoken <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">from the beginning </a>about her gray roots, sharing updates throughout. Recently, she even made a joke about it!</p><p>On Saturday, August 15, the Live With Kelly and Ryan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a meme</a> that showcased her roots getting grayer each month as part of the #2020Challenge. “Perhaps this meme is a week old at this point … but does that really compare to these roots?” she captioned the post. “My version of the #2020Calendar is just … real.”</p><p>Given the constantly evolving nature of COVID-19, Us Weekly wants our readers to have access to the most accurate resources.
