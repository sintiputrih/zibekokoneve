Maybe we should have said it’s good to be a comic and actor that reminds people they exist via their highly successful podcasts?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">How much is Tom Segura worth?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Tom Segura and Bert Kreischer in 2023.</p></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> and others, the 44-year-old performer is worth somewhere between $12 and $15 million dollars. In addition to the aforementioned podcasts, Tom’s financial worth stems from five <a href=#>Netflix</a> stand-up specials (the well received Sledgehammer from 2023, Ballhog from 2020, Disgraceful from 2018, Mostly Stories from 2016, Completely Normal from 2014), merch from the podcasts (there are over 100 items in their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">store</a>), acting roles and performing live. Lots and lots of gigs.</p><p class="sc-ljslrt jczKas"><span>Tom Segura</span></p><p class="sc-htmbXw iarkkR">Stand-up comedian</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $12-$15 million</p><p style=text-align:start>Tom Segura is a stand-up comedian and actor.

He’s one of the few working comedians able to play mostly arenas. Coming up in<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 2024</a> he’ll be headlining massive rooms like the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, The Kia Forum in Inglewood, and about three dozen more places that hold more than 10,000+ people per show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Telling jokes, recording podcasts, and selling vodka.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>In addition to the extremely successful stand-up tours and long-running podcasts, Tom may be making some money from his recently launched vodka. On February 5, 2024, it was announced that Tom and podcast partner Bert Kreischer were lending their names to a new spirit brand, Por Osos.</p><p>From the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a>, “Por Osos, translated from Spanish (because of Tom's Peruvian background, and Spanish speaking deep cuts), meaning "for the bears" is a play on their top comedy podcast 2 Bears, 1 Cave. This vodka is by the bears, for the bears - their audience! Crafted with the utmost dedication to quality, this gluten-free vodka stands out by using only premium ingredients, including non-GMO wheat, and a patented finishing process from Persedo CRAFT technology that sets it apart."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Which is more fun?

In February 2024, Tom joked that Bert was recording part of their new episode from jail. Joked. It was a joke. The vodka is real, the jail time is a joke. We hope. It's hard to make vodka money from behind bars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbyuedKenq6qkWK7psCMsKarrJg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sage-stallones-mom-begged-surgery-weeks-death.html><span>←</span><span>Sage Stallone's Mom Begged Him Not to Get Surgery Weeks Before Death</span></a>
