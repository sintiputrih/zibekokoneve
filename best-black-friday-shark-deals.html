It offers powerful, effective cleaning for all kinds of floor types, including rugs, hard floors, carpets, and more. The easy-empty dirt cup and detachable top form — to offer a handheld unit — add even more versatility to the equation.</p><h2>Hoover Dirt Devil Power Express Upright Bagless Vacuum — $50, was $59</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>If you’re looking for a versatile, lightweight vacuum that won’t dent your budget, check out the Dirt Devil Power Express Upright Bagless Vacuum.

It also comes with a space-saving wall mount that acts as a charger. An LED shows you important details like battery life, while a motorized brush with LED light makes it easy to clean hard-to-reach spaces and see what’s happening. Battery life is estimated at 35 minutes of runtime per charge, which is great.</p><h2>Buture Lightweight Cordless Stick Vacuum — $140, was $400</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>This pet-home-friendly cordless stick vacuum comes with a host of accessories, like a roller brush, electric floor brush, crevice nozzle, brush cleaner tool and much more. It also converts easily into a handheld unit for more maneuverability. The LED touchscreen allows you to configure settings and see details at a glance, like battery life.

It delivers 30,000 Pascals of suction power and has a large 2-liter capacity dust box to hold debris.</p><h2>Bissell CleanView Allergen Lift-Off Upright Vacuum — $170, was $237</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Every purchase of Bissell’s pet-friendly vacuums, like the CleanView Allergen Lift-Off, will help save homeless pets — proceedings go to the Bissell Pet Foundation. That’s a great little bonus for your purchase, but this vacuum is also powerful and super convenient. The lift-off technology allows you to pick it up and get into out-of-reach places thanks to a removable and portable canister. The tangle-free brush roll, HEPA-sealed filtration, swivel steering, and ultra-lightweight design add to its usability. It also comes with onboard pet tools like a dusting brush and crevice tool.</p><h2>Shark Pet Cordless Stick Vacuum — $200, was $260</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ramping it up in the power department thanks to Shark’s hypervelocity suction technology, this vacuum offers a deep clean for everyday messes in high-traffic areas.

You’ll get up to 40 minutes of runtime on a single charge, with a low-profile design, portability — thanks to the cordless build — and an extra-large dust cap with an easy-clean ejector for the debris. LED headlights ensure you can see dark or hidden areas, plus the removable hand vacuum allows you to clean couches, furniture, and more.</p><h2>Shark Vertex DuoClean PowerFin Upright Vacuum — $300, was $450</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The lift-away pod allows you to detach this vacuum’s dustbin and nozzle for easier portability, but the DuoClean PowerFins and high suction make for an excellent and powerful system.

This model will give you 40 minutes of runtime on a single charge with a de-tangling motorbar cleaner head, perfect for pet homes. A hair screw tool simplifies removing pet hair from upholstery and tight spaces and then sucks it all up with the vacuum. Whole-machine HEPA filtration ensures everything captured stays in the dustbin. Moreover, the vacuum quickly converts into a handheld unit with no loss of suction incurred — thanks to 15 cyclones working in tandem across two tiers, increasing airflow.</p><h2>LG CordZero Cordless Stick Vacuum — $450, was $700</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>LG’s CordZero merges several variants of innovative technology, including a smart inverter motor, Kompressor technology — for easy dustbin empties — and ThinQ AI care through the related app. It’s no secret why the CordZero series is a mainstay in the <a href=#>best cordless vacuum deals</a>. Plus, it comes with two upgraded quick-release batteries that are super easy to swap out, giving you a maximum of 120 minutes of runtime and plenty of time to clean even extra-large homes and interiors.

It’s equally powerful and intelligent for whole-home deep cleaning, no matter how big the mess. 125,000 rpm generates 100% more power than comparable vacuums, with 60 minutes of runtime on a single charge. As you clean, the LCD shows you picked up particles and the level of cleaning your vacuum is administering, keeping you both in full control and in the know while you work. A fluffy optic cleaner head helps collect and reveal hidden dust on the floor with a hair tool that sucks up pet hair on furniture too. It easily converts into a handheld unit for better portability. It comes with a total of seven Dyson accessories, has built-in HEPA filtration, and employs a super lightweight design.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">More Unmissable Deals</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfnbyusY6bnKysXZe5oq%2FKZp2roZSWxm6%2Fx5qppGWUmq6tv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./angelina-jolie-photo-instagram-atelier.html><span>←</span><span>Angelina Jolie Looks Chic Hosting Art Discussion at Her Atelier</span></a>
