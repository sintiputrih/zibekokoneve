Woods, 39, has not participated since 2004, before his kids were born, but they asked to take part in this year’s festivities.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all">“I said, ‘Okay, we’ll see,'” he told <a href=#>ESPN</a> on Wednesday of the cuties, whose mom is his ex-wife <strong>Elin Nordegren</strong>. “It comes closer, and I hadn’t played in a while, and they started bringing it up.”</p><p>The little ones — daughter Sam, 7, and son Charlie, 6 — went all in for the outing, donning miniature versions of Augusta National’s trademark white caddie jumpsuits and the Masters’ iconic green hats. Woods color-coordinated in a light green and black Nike golf shirt, while Vonn sported a similarly hued mint maxi dress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to <a href=#>USA Today</a>, “Charlie was in charge of carrying the clubs while Sam wiped grass and dirt off the ball between holes.” Sam also took a shot for her dad on the putting green for the sixth hole — and made it in!</p><p>“Charlie plays a little bit and Sam likes to keep score and, obviously, tell us when we mess up,” he shared with ESPN. “So it’s a good combo.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After the tournament, the four-time Masters champ released a statement through his publicist about the family affair, saying, “We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He also <a href=#>tweeted</a> about the experience. “I’ll always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie,” he wrote. “An amazing day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Indeed, Woods <a href=#>told the Associated Press</a> on Tuesday, April 7, how happy he was to have his kids around for this week’s tournament.</p><p>“To now have come full circle and to have a chance to have my kids out there and be able to share that with them, it’s special,” he raved. “It’s nice to be able to share these things with my family and it just means the world to me. They are excited, I’m excited and can’t wait to go out there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatoZeav27DzqibrGWbnrG0ecCrnGasmJp6pMHTnqqtZZekuad5wpqbnaGVqHqxtcKsZLChpJ16rbXNnaqesV2rvK%2B6jGtnam1paXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-rookie-season-6-release-window-cast-plot-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>The Rookie season 6 release window, cast, plot, and more</span></a>
