And what better place than one of your adventures to find them? Juhie Faheem knew this! Thus, she joined </span><i><span>Love Is Blind</span></i><span> Season 2 to find that one person who’d synchronize with her.</span></p><p><span>This Juhie Faheem Bio explores her life.</span></p><h3><b>Juhie Faheem On Love Is Blind Season 2</b></h3><p><span>Finally, after 2 years hiatus, Netflix’s </span><i><span>Love is Blind</span></i><span> returned for its second installment on Feb 11, 2022, and it saw 30 singles (15 male and 15 female) including Juhie, ready to take their shots at love.</span></p><p><span>Just like the inaugural season, the show introduced the couples through their respective pods, unable to see each other, however, able to communicate as much as they want. So, once they’ve decided, the potential husband/wife would then embark on a trip to a romantic destination, and meet each other’s family before deciding if they want to get married in the final ep or not.</span></p><p><span>Super excited to see herself, Juhie took it to her IG on the day of the show’s premiere to write, “So excited to announce that I’m one of the Season 2 cast members of @loveisblindnetflix!
