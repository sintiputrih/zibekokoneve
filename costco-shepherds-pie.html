Though in England a traditional shepherd’s pie is technically made with ground lamb, while beef makes it a cottage pie, in the US it seems like shepherd’s pie is usually made with beef, and the Costco version adheres to that tradition.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Each Costco shepherd’s pie is made with ground beef, beef au jus, Burgundy wine, carrots, corn, peas, mushrooms, and onions, and is topped with a cloud of fluffy mashed potatoes. It’s pretty affordable, too, at just $3.79 a pound, and according to Instagram account <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@CostcoDeals</a>, most of them cost about $20 total. Not bad for a meal that can feed the whole family, especially when you think about how much the individual ingredients would cost to make the pie, and the time you’d have to take out of your day to actually make one.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to commenters on Instagram, the pie is pretty delicious. Someone called it “the absolute BEST premade meal Costco makes,” though others noted that the pie used to have cheese on top. “Put the cheese back on the top! Stop being so cheap!” So, those who do pick up a shepherd’s pie from Costco might want to add some shredded cheese on top while it heats up in the oven, for a bit of extra cozy flavor.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This is just one of many quick and easy dinner options available at Costco, so if you feel like you’re always struggling to put a satisfying meal on the table, the selection of ready-made dinners alone might be worth the cost of your <a href=# rel=nofollow>Costco membership</a>.</p><p><strong>Before you go, check out <a href=# rel=noopener>our gallery</a> below:</strong> <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cold-brew.jpg alt="cold brew coffee" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">This Easy-To-Clean Cold Brew Maker Works With Your Favorite Wide-Mouth Mason Jars & Basically Pays For Itself</span></a></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/costco-products.jpg alt width=640 height=360 sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Watch: We Tried Ina Garten’s Overnight Mac & Cheese & We Totally Get Why It Broke the Internet</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp%2BmqJxdlruledGemqKolah8or7TopqlnaNkf3d%2FlG1nbWeTpMC1r85mqqGdoJ2ys7DSZqeinV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./which-nfl-football-team-does-serena-williams-own-a-part-of.html><span>←</span><span>Which NFL football team does Serena Williams own a part of?</span></a>
