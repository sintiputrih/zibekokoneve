Cowher led the team to victory in Super Bowl XL, while Tomlin secured a win in Super Bowl XLIII. Their leadership has solidified the Steelers' reputation as one of the most successful franchises in NFL history.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Pittsburgh Steelers, a storied American football franchise, have enjoyed success under the ownership of the Rooney family.
