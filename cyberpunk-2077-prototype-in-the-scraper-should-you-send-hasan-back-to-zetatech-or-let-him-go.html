During the call with Mr. Hands, reveal his coordinates, and the fixer will send an escort to drive him back to his corp the day after. This ends all contact with Hasan but still gets you the same reward as the alternative: 8,000 Eurodollars and 1355 EXP.</p><h2>Phantom Liberty Prototype in the Scraper: Let Hasan Go</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Cyberpunk-Prototype-Hasen-1.jpg><p>If you <strong>let Hasan go during any instance</strong>, you’ll only have the schematics to hand into Mr. Hands. If you’re fully honest with him instead of keeping the truth buried, he won’t be as disappointed in your performance.</p><p data-injection=true>Don’t just let Hassan go in the first or second instance to achieve this. Instead, choose the “Calling the Fixer, no fast moves” option, and tell <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mr. Hands</a> what has happened with the operation. The schematics should be handed to a man on the next day, and you’ll receive the same rewards: 8,000 Eurodollars and 1355 EXP</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077 Treating Symptoms: Should You Neutralize Milko Alexis or Let NetWatch Finish The Op</a></p><h2>Cyberpunk 2077: What is The Best Outcome to Prototype in the Scraper?</h2><p>Since the reward is the same whether you hand out the schematics alone or the schematics and prototype together, I think the <strong>best choice is to let Hasan go</strong>. Because I was playing Corpo Rat and also had a prototype chip engrained in my brain, I could easily relate to Hasan and decided to let the man go while staying honest with Mr. Hands.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dd39bd735ebf6fbf05d2fe8f91a978f7?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Cande Maldonado</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Though Cande started her journey in the video game industry as a localization specialist six years ago, she soon realized that her true calling was to annoy NPCS, smash virtual pottery, and complete every side quest available in RPGs.

Her passion for games dates to 2006, when she mounted a Chocobo for the first time.
