I’m witches. Never fear, the “willow lonely witch remix” is here". The post is sharing news of a stripped back version of the single "Willow" off of the evermore album which is full of witch themes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is clear that "Willow" is dedicated to those of us who are lonely (and dramatic!) and love to zone out while we immerse ourselves in weepy, sad tunes. And it's great to hear that Taylor is just like us!</p><p>This wouldn't be the first time that Swift gets "witchy," TayTay's entire 2020 album evermore is chock-full of witch motifs and fully embraced the vibe of wooden cabins and special fairies. In fact, both evermore and folklore invoke imagery of the woods, wispy details, and feminine mystery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What We've Learned From Taylor Swift's Intimate 'Folklore' Recording Sessions</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lopqzpr7SZquoZZiav7Sxy59kmqtdlnq4tdOcn2ahnmK7psOMqaasrF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-fishenfeld-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Fishenfeld Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
