And to me, he was like, ‘You’re not going to tell me what to do. I’ll let you know it’s going to be OK.’ He was always that strength for me,” Kardashian concluded. “So I’ll always love and appreciate him for always standing up for me.”</p><p>She added, “Anyone who has ever doubted us or me, he has always been there to hold my hand and lift me up higher and give me the confidence.
