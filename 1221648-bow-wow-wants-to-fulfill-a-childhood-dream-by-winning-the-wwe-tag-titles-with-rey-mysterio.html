In addition, Cedric Alexander and Shelton Benjamin of The Hurt Business and Dolph Ziggler & Robert Roode are&nbsp;the respective tag champs on RAW and SmackDown, so if he plans to be a champion soon, he (and Rey) would have to go through one of those teams.</p><p>Bow Wow officially announced he was retiring from rapping in 2016 and had planned on calling his final album NYLTH, but it has still not been released. As of late, Bow Wow has been building his acting resume, appearing on&nbsp;Growing Up Hip Hop: Atlanta and on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;as The Frog. He is scheduled to appear as “Twinkie” in the ninth film in the Fast And The Furious franchise, F9.&nbsp;</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Now i know this might sound crazy… BUT… after i drop my last album.
