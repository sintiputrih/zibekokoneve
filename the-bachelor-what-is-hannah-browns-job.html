Some fans have said that Brown would be amazing if she was on season 16 of&nbsp;The Bachelorette. According to&nbsp;Cheat Sheet, host Chris Harrison says that he understands why people wish for that as Brown is so great. He said, in an interview with Us Weekly,&nbsp;"Look, anything’s possible. I’m not against it. I think the things that make us love her so much — and I’m included in that and adore her — is she is so open and honest and just, she’s a train wreck. You get to see the good, the bad and the ugly in Hannah and that’s a rare thing in any human being.”</p><p>In August 2020, she shared with her Instagram followers that she was feeling emotional on the one year anniversary of her storyline on&nbsp;The Bachelorette, according to&nbsp;People.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hannah-Brown.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brown wrote,&nbsp;“Today feels really symbolic for me. As I get ready to move into a new home, I realize that I am starting a new chapter and closing another. (Which is a big deal because I’m usually rushing to the next chapter before I finish the one before).”</p><p>Brown continued that she didn't have any regrets and didn't wish that things had gone differently. She wrote, "I’m thankful for every single one of my experiences and the subsequent moments of growth, and of course, I’m thankful for all of you! Tough times don’t feel so rough when you have some pretty great friends on the internet rooting for ya along the way! Cheers, to new beginnings y’all!” It sounds like Brown learned some great lessons on the reality show and will bring those with her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hannah Brown Reminisces The Time She Was Kissed By Idol Shania Twain</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It'll be interesting to see where Hannah Brown goes next and what kind of job she has in her future.
