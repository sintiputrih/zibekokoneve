Life has continued to work in ways neither of&nbsp;[us] expected, and sadly life will be taking us in different directions,” <a href=#>Michie wrote via&nbsp;Instagram&nbsp;at the time</a>. “This isn’t because of bad actions or words, rather, two people who deeply love each other recognizing that a relationship may not be for the best. … I said it on the show and I will say it always, I love her and she will forever hold a special place in my heart.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The former couple met on the 21st season of the CBS reality show, in which they placed first and second, respectively.
