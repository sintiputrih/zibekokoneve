Completing them (and other activities found throughout the game) will sometimes reward you with special Voyage Coins that can be traded for Pirate Coins at the following exchange rates:</p><p><strong>Guiena’s Coin</strong> = 10 Pirate Coins<br><strong>Krater’s Coin</strong> = 12 Pirate Coins<br><strong>Coin of Arcturth</strong> = 15 Pirate Coins<br><strong>Ancient Coins</strong> = 17 Pirate Coins<br><strong>Solar Coin</strong> = 20 Pirate Coins</p><p>In short, you can often expect to earn a few extra Pirate Coins by completing certain nautical activities. However, if you’re interested in earning as many coins as possible as quickly as possible, you’ll need to learn to maximize your time.</p><h2>Lost Ark: Pirate Coin Farming Spots and Tips</h2><p>While it doesn’t really count as “farming” in the traditional MMO sense of the word, you really should try to complete as many Island Quests as possible in order to maximize your Pirate Coin earning potential. Nothing compares to Island Quests in terms of the fastest and easiest ways to earn as many Pirate Coins as possible.</p><p>On that topic, you will want to keep an eye open for the start of the Procyon’s Compass event, which rewards you with bonus Pirate Coins for completing special assignments related to Field Bosses, Ghost Ships, Chaos Gate activities, and Island Quests. It’s very much worth going out of your way to participate in this event whenever it is available to you.</p><p>Beyond that, your best bet for earning Pirate Coins is to complete Marine Events whenever they appear and as quickly as possible. They’re your most consistent source for Pirate Coins once the Islands Quest well has run dry. The same goes for Una’s Tasks: daily and weekly events that often reward you with quite a few precious Pirate Coins. Much like Procyon’s Compass, taking advantage of these opportunities means scheduling your time in a way that allows you to pretty much jump on them as soon as possible. It’s not the end of the world if you miss one here and there, but it might be a good idea to devote certain <strong>Lost Ark</strong> sessions to acquiring as many Pirate Coins as possible so that you don’t have to worry about earning smaller quantities of them here and there through the normal course of play.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8yoraKdXa%2B8r7GOpaasrF2Wv6x5x6iuZqyfYrOivsxmp6Kqkamybq%2FOoqWsZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-97-ipad-pro-review.html><span>←</span><span>Camera Performance - The 9.7&amp;quot; iPad Pro Review</span></a>
