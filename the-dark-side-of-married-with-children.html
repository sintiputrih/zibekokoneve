When she was 21, her mom died of a heart attack. Then, just a few years later, her father was killed in a freak helicopter accident when he was filming a TV series. "My way of dealing [with] things in the moment was to very much check out, was to kind of anesthetize myself, numb myself," she told the outlet. Sagal hid her drug addiction, but her burgeoning acting career also motivated her to get sober. One day, she met a woman on a TV set who was going through a similar experience; her advice helped to completely transform Sagal's life. After speaking to the woman, Sagal discovered that sobriety was a pathway entirely within her grasp.</p><p>In a chat with <a href=#>Bustle</a>, she revealed that within just two months of getting sober, she landed her role on "Married...With Children." Accordingly, the show aided her recovery from addiction. "I stayed sober, and watched all the people around me, and I learned how to do what I do now," she stated.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know is struggling with addiction issues, help is available. Visit the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website</a> or contact SAMHSA's National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW5laIBze9OhnGackae4br%2FInZxmp5ZiuqK%2B0aKcnWWnnsGpecKhoKWcopq7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sara-gilbert.html><span>←</span><span>Sara Gilbert</span></a>
