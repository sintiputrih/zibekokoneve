In fact, Gomez is all smiles in the shots, flaunting Coach's new Parker bag, likely in part of her partnership with the brand.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She serves face with a floor pose:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Then she flashes a big smile:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And she finishes with a subtle smirk:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">No Weeknd clapbacks to see here.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Gomez and The Weeknd, née Abel Tesfaye, went their separate ways <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a13120861/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-breakup/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="in October 2017" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">in October 2017</a>, after about 10 months together. Selena reunited with longtime on-and-off boyfriend Justin Bieber shortly afterwards, but that rekindled romance reportedly <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a19606657/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-breakup-report/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=extinguished class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">extinguished</a> this month.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Tesfaye-Gomez-Bieber love triangle appears to be a big inspiration for The Weeknd's My Dear Melancholy album, and <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a19640358/the-weeknd-lyrics-selena-gomez-bella-hadid/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fans seem to agree" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">fans seem to agree</a>. Listeners mainly pointed out the track "Call Out My Name" for being loaded with Selena references.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For example, there's the line, "I almost cut a piece of myself for your life," which is believed to allude to Gomez's <a href=# data-external=true data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a13108123/selena-gomez-francia-raisa-kidney-transplant/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="kidney transplant" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">kidney transplant</a> last summer. And theres the lyric, "Guess I was just another pit stop / 'Til you made up your mind / You just wasted my time," which hints at Gomez's reuniting with Bieber following her split from The Weeknd.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Other tracks on the record also appear to reference their relationship, as well as Tesfaye's previous romance with Bella Hadid.
