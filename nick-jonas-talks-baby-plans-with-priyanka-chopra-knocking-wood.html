I’m not so sure.”</p><p>The couple <a href=#>got engaged in July 2018</a> after two months of dating. Three months later, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that <a href=#>they couldn’t “wait to get married”</a> and start a family. “They have amazing chemistry and can’t wait to have kids,” the insider said in October 2018. “[They] keep talking about starting a family together.”</p><p>That same month, the actress told E! News that since “a few of [her] friends” were having babies, she needed “to catch up.”</p><p>Chopra Jonas <a href=#>wed</a> the Grammy nominee in December 2018 in two ceremonies in India. While<a href=#> celebrating their first anniversary</a>, Jonas posted a throwback photo from their nuptials via Instagram.</p><p>“One year ago today we said forever … well forever isn’t nearly long enough,” the former Disney Channel star wrote in December 2019. “I love you with all of my heart @priyankachopra happy anniversary.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Unfinished author gushed in a post of her own: “My promise. Then … today … forever. You bring me joy, grace, balance, excitement, passion … all in the same moment. Thank you for finding me. Happy first wedding anniversary Husband.. @nickjonas. And thank you to everyone for the love and good wishes. We feel blessed.”</p><p>The following month, Chopra Jonas exclusively told Us that her husband is “the best guy,” explaining, “Just knowing that I have my husband by my side is the best perk of all.”</p><p>She and the Texas native <a href=#>“still like each other” while quarantining</a> amid the coronavirus pandemic. “We both have had such individual careers that I don’t think we would’ve had six months with each other ever, so that’s really a blessing,” the White Tiger star told <a href=#><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong> </a>in January. “I was really happy to be able to have that time with each other.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGanoZOgequ7zZqqZqyRobi0ecGambJloKGur7%2BMsKCtoF2lv6rFwKeimmWTnbyxvsBmoqenk6C2r7OMsKaonF8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./marisa-tomeis-next-level-age-defying-secrets-w495882.html><span>←</span><span>Marisa Tomeis Next Level Age-Defying Secrets</span></a>
