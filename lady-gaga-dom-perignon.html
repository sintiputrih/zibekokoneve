This is a woman who soared from the roof of a Super Bowl stadium, arrived at the Grammys in an egg, and performed at the presidential inauguration like it was her own show. If she's going to do anything, she's going to do it her way—even when it comes to champagne.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Two weeks ago, we saw the star's creative mind at work yet again when she unveiled a new campaign under her partnership Dom Pérignon. A collaboration with fashion photographer Nick Knight and longtime creative director Nicola Formichetti, the eye-popping visuals feature Gaga in sweeping pink gowns and kaleidoscopic settings while displaying a bottle of Dom Pérignon Rosé Vintage 2005.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The campaign, titled The Queendom, is meant to be a celebration of creative freedom. (The accompanying short film is soundtracked by a Gaga Chromatica track, "Free Woman.") And that's exactly what Gaga and her team tapped into for this project.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My creative collaborators and I put a lot of energy and love into this campaign," Gaga tells BAZAAR.com in an email. "I feel there's a special alchemy that happens when we create together. In this case it was the amazing legend Nick Knight, and the Haus of Gaga including Nicola, Richy, Freddie, and Sarah. Together, we wanted to invite people into the Queendom to experience the power of creative freedom. I think Nick's edit truly captures this energy and the world of Dom Pérignon Rosé."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the imagery, Gaga wears rosy ensembles from Wiederhoeft and Miodrag Guberinic, along with uber-long nails, thick platform heels, and otherworldly headpieces and jewelry.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The fashion also immerses you into the Queendom," Gaga adds. "I love that the style and looks can't be defined by any one era. There are historical details evoking a queen's dress, but with a modern influence. To me this embodies Dom Pérignon Rosé, which is about casting aside conventions and continually pushing boundaries."</p><img alt="lady gaga" title="lady gaga" width=1562 height=2238 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/queen-vertical-no-logo-rgb-c-nick-knight-1618610339.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Nick Knight</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The highlight of Gaga's new partnership with the brand is a limited-edition sculpture, which envelopes the champagne bottle and was designed together by Gaga and Formichetti. There are only 110 pieces to be sold in private sales, and the proceeds will benefit Gaga's Born This Way Foundation.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The superstar has clearly put a lot of work into her new creative partnership with Dom Pérignon, but what about enjoying a glass of the bubbly herself?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For me, it's not about where, but when," she also says in her email. "I like to toast with Dom Pérignon to celebrate life. To celebrate achievements. To celebrate each other. And to celebrate the kindness in the world.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For example, a special moment for me was after we won an Academy Award for Best Song for 'Shallow.' We had a huge toast of Dom backstage at the Oscars with my cowriters Mark Ronson, Anthony Rossomando, and Andrew Wyatt, my family and friends who were there, and my team. It's a moment I'll never forget."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
