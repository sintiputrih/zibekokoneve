She is loved by the people for her authenticity and her dedication to portraying the character she plays. She is revered by many audiences and her fellow artist.</p><p>Her interviews indicate that she is a victim of domestic abuse and assault; however, she managed to leave that relationship to live her life as an independent woman living on her own terms.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=idah-alishas-husband-wedding></span>Idah Alisha’s Husband & Wedding<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Idah was married to a man named Roy Upton, with who she has alleged to have been abusive.

She has said that she sold her wedding dress before she left for the US. She managed to come to the US and turned her life around.</p><p>She was recently seen talking about her life in her recent interview, where she was crying, and the host too was shocked and saddened by her devasted marriage.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-idah-alisha-married-in-2022></span>Is Idah Alisha Married in 2022?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of rumor, Idah is married.
