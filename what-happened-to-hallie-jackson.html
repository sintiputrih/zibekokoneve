According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>, Hallie Jackson will no longer anchor her show Live With Hallie Jackson. The outlet shares that Hallie is one of 75 staffers at NBC and MSNBC that were laid off. However, Hallie is not without future prospects.</p><p>She is said to be focusing on her show Hallie Jackson Now, which will run from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays on NBC News Now, the network's streaming service.</p><p>As for Hallie’s former slot on MSNBC, Katy Tur took her place as of Feb. 13, 2023.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Hallie Jackson (@hallie_gram)</a></p></figure><p>Hallie also took to social media to share the bittersweet news with fans.</p><p>“It's so bittersweet to say goodbye to a team of absolute legitimate rockstars who have poured their hearts into this show — the staff past and present who have made the broadcast everything it is, from the road shows to rolling coverage to special coverage and beyond,” Hallie wrote on Instagram.</p><p>She continued, “Now? The headfirst jump into a new adventure begins: taking on a bigger and broader role on the @nbcnews side of the house. More stories, more hours (two of them, to be exact) every night on @nbcnewsnow.”</p><p>Hallie also went on to share that she will maintain her anchoring gigs on Today and NBC Nightly News.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There is a chance that more layoffs will follow at NBC and MSNBC.</h2><p>The New York Post shares that the initial layoffs followed the news of NBC News president Noah Oppenheim stepping down from his position.
