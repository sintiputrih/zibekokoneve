Madeleine McCann’s case, one of the most heavily reported missing-person cases in modern history.</h3><h2><span id=Early_life_and_Childhood>Early life and Childhood</span></h2><p>Madeleine McCann was a<strong> three-year-old</strong> British toddler who got lost during her family vacation. She went missing on the evening of May 3, 2007, during a family holiday trip to Portugal. Her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann got suspects during the height of the investigation by the Portuguese police. But they have since been removed.</p><p>Her parents used private investigators additionally to the Portuguese investigation. In 2011 they got even more support by Scotland Yard, which started its own inquiry, called Operation Grange. Even though the 10th anniversary of her disappearance passed in May 2017, she is still one of the most famous missing-persons cases in the U.K. and in Portugal.</p><p>Following her kidnapping, the McCanns were subordinated to a British media circus reminiscent of that surrounding the death of Princess Diana. They have bestowed losses in 2008 for the exploitation of their family by the press.</p><h4><span>Birthdate and Parents</span></h4><p>She was born on May 12, 2003, in Leicester, England, under the astrological sign Taurus. Her father’s name is Gerry McCann and her mother’s name is Kate McCann. They both are physicians. Born in 1968 near Liverpool, her mother Kate graduated from the University of Dundee with a degree in medicine. Although she has trained in several fields and has taken time off, she is now a general practitioner.</p><p>Her father Gerry was born in 1968 in Glasgow and certified from the University of Glasgow with a bachelor’s in physiology/sports science in 1989. In 2002 he earned his medical degree. Currently, he is a cardiologist consultant.</p><p>In 1993, the duo met in Glasgow and married five years later. They welcomed their first baby Madeleine in 2003. Later, they gave birth to twins Sean and Amelie in 2005.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-38738 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Madeleine-McCann-parents.jpg alt="Madeleine McCann" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-38738 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Madeleine McCann’s parent picture with a poster of her (Source: YouTube)</p><h2><span id=Updates>Updates</span></h2><p>As of January 2018, British and Portuguese police reportedly looked into significant streets of business. The officials started pursuing a “person of significance” that, according to Scotland Yard, has become a “critical line of inquiry.” The inquiry has even relinquished Bulgaria, where officials are seeking for a “woman in purple” they want to bring in for examination.</p><p>The British Metropolitan Police assume her stolen during a botched robbery or by child sex traffickers or the like. A retired Met police chief has inquired that her parents, Kate and Gerry, as well as their friends who were dining with them that night (known as the Tapas Seven) be questioned again since they’ve never been interviewed by British officials.</p><p>Ever since her disappearance, there have been over 8,000 possible sightings of her, with the inquiry relinquishing close to a controversial £ 12 million pounds (almost $17 million US dollars).</p><h2><span id=The_Story_Timeline_of_Events>The Story / Timeline of Events</span></h2><p>The McCanns left three-year-old Maddie and her two-year-old twin siblings, Sean and Amelie at the end of a week-long family holiday in Portugal. Children were unattended and rented in the apartment at the resort Praia da Luz in the Algarve region. And they were having dinner at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends on the night of May 3, 2007.</p><p>The McCann family was on holiday along with seven other friends (eight children in total) and began dining around 8:30 pm. They dined in the restaurant which was about 180 feet away from the apartment. They left their kids on unsecured place and was open to the public. Every parent on the holiday look rounds checking on their respective children during the night, and it was at around 10 pm that her mother Kate McCann discovered Madeleine was missing.</p><p>In the leading immediate weeks, the Portuguese officials considered the McCanns were responsible for the disappearance of their daughter, creating a theory that their daughter had unexpectedly died in the apartment and they had gotten relieved of her body. In September 2007, her parents have labeled arguidos (suspects), but a year later, the label was lifted due to a lack of evidence.</p><p>When the Portuguese chief inspector that directed the case to find her, Goncalo Amaral, abdicated in 2008. He quickly thereafter released a book, The Truth of the Lie, which became a best seller. In it, he claims that she unexpectedly died in the apartment, and in an endeavor to cover it up, her parents pretended her abduction. Calling the book “downright lies,” Kate and Gerry McCann Goncalo sued for lying in 2009. But later he won. In April 2016, a claims court overturned the decision.</p><h2><span id=10th_Anniversary_of_Madeleine8217s_Disappearance>10th Anniversary of Madeleine’s Disappearance</span></h2><p>On the eve of the 10th anniversary of Madeleine’s disappearance in 2017, the McCanns sat down for an interview with The Guardian. They expressed also expressed determination that they would find their daughter.</p><h2><span id=Netflix_documentary_8216The_Disappearance_of_Madeleine_McCann8217>Netflix documentary: ‘The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann’</span></h2><p>In March of 2019, Netflix exposed the eight-part docuseries The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann. Entering two months’ ere her 16th birthday, the series returns the early investigations. It concentrated on the parents as likely perpetrators of the crime, as well as a later one by British authorities. It even presented a list of 38 viable suspects which have not been investigated.</p><p>Despite appearing during the documentary through old video clips and media footage, the parents did not join in its production. They wrote on their Find Madeleine website “We did not see and still do not see how this program will help the search for she and, particularly given there is an active police investigation, could potentially hinder it”.</p><h2><span id=Physical_Description>Physical Description</span></h2><p>Madeleine McCann reported having blonde hair and green-blue eyes. The most significant physical characteristics she had was a brown spot on her left calf and a rare, dark patch in the iris of her right eye.</p><h2><span id=Her_Age>Her Age</span></h2><p>Madeleine McCann was three years old at the time of her disappearance. In 2012, a forensic artist displayed a digital depiction of what she might’ve looked like at age nine. However, as of 2020, she is already 17 years old.</p><h2><span id=Is_Madeleine_McCann_still_alive>Is Madeleine McCann still alive?</span></h2><p>Madeleine McCann is still alive. Currently, she is living in Germany with a new identity, police psychic claims. According to Fia Johansson, she has reportedly worked with US law enforcement agencies on missing person cases. And she believes the missing girl now called Melanie and living with an elderly couple. A psychic who works with police has sensationally claimed it.</p><p>The child left her family’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on the evening of May 3, 2007. Her case sparked a wide-ranging police hunt that has crossed the globe and continues to this day. However, psychic Fia Johansson has reportedly worked with US law enforcement agencies on missing person cases and believes the girl is alive and well. Currently, she has no clue about her other family as she was very little, she doesn’t remember anything about the family.</p><p>She was supposedly kidnapped by a German child trafficker who has since been jailed, Fia claims. After two years of her taken away from her parent, a woman from the crime gang felt pity for her and supported her escape, Fia added. The psychic originally made this unbelievable allegation back in October.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCmmaOge6S7zGikmpyVobKqusRmpJybkaO7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jenna-warren.html><span>←</span><span>Jenna Warren</span></a>
