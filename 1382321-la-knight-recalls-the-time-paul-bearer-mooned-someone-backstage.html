During their time at NWA Championship Wrestling, Knight recalled a time where Bearer mooned someone doing a pre-taped promo, causing the whole place to break down laughing.</p><p>“One of the guys was doing a pre taped promo before the show started that day, and at some point he just pulled his whole big fat ass out and broke the take,” said LA Knight. “He was behind the camera, and just mooned the guy. The whole place just broke down!”</p><p>Knight would go on to praise Bearer — real name Percy Pringle III — for his advice and their relationship, which lasted about three or four years.</p><p>“He was such a nice guy – unless you got on his bad side, then he would ride your ass hard,’ said LA Knight. “Whenever I would call him or message him or whatever for advice, he was always very, very, very appreciative about it…That ended up being a three or four year working relationship, friendship, and then of course he passed. Man, yeah, you’re talking about rubbing elbows with a guy who’s been with everybody. You name it, he’s been there. For me to be amongst that company, that was pretty wild.”</p><p>Knight will compete in the Men’s Money in the Bank Ladder Match at WWE Money in the Bank on July 1. WrestleZone will have coverage of the show as it airs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJxaWxqYWK5onnKp6CgoKRiv6avwKWjrGWknbJuwMimnGaokaq5bq7Emqmeql2ivLC6xJ1krKedmryvsYybmJyjo6muqLE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-mulkey-wiki-bio-age.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Mulkey Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Weight, Basketball, Net Worth, Son</span></a>
