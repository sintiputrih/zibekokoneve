Whether its in the movie business, on television, or in the music industry, plenty of stars have gotten into spats with others, and you had better believe that the media is all over these stories. Stars like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z</a> have all been involved in a feud at some point during their time in the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in the 80s, Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney seemed to be fast friends, but things would eventually reach a screeching halt when the two engaged in a public feud. These two titans of the music industry certainly made news with their fallout, and there was a lot going on.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look at Paul McCartney’s feud with Michael Jackson!</p><h2 id=the-former-friends-made-music-together>The Former Friends Made Music Together</h2><p>Before the two became engaged in a feud against one another, Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney were friends that were making some music together. By that point, McCartney was a Beatles alumn, while Jackson had already served a successful stint at the primary talent in the Jackson 5.</p><p>During the 80s, the pair would collaborate on songs like “Say Say Say,” “The Girl Is Mine,” and “The Man.” Both of these men were musical geniuses in their own right, and fans could hardly believe that they would be working together on some music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was plenty of success to be found for the duo and their collaborations. “Say Say Say” was a legitimate number 1 hit for the pair on the&nbsp;Billboard charts, and it would eventually reach a&nbsp;Platinum certification, according to&nbsp;RIAA. Sure, these songs would not be going down as classics, but they were still a success that showed the people that they could do amazing things together.</p><p>Eventually, however, a unique business venture would be up for grabs, and this was the precise moment that things cooled down between these two legends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sir Paul McCartney Almost Asked Taylor Swift To Perform ‘Shake It Off’ With Him This Summer</a></span></p><h2 id=jackson-buys-the-beatles-music>Jackson Buys The Beatles’ Music</h2><p>According to&nbsp;The Vintage News, ATV Music, which eventually became known as Sony Music, was selling a massive catalog of music in 1985. Part of this collection was the music of The Beatles, and Paul wanted nothing more than to buy his music back so that he could officially own it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead of being able to get his hands on the music from ATV, McCartney was outbid for the massive catalog by none other than Michael Jackson. Jackson saw the value in being able to own and license music, and this led him to spending nearly $50 million on all of the ATV tracks.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Vintage News</a> shows that the massive collection of music featured tracks from people like Elvis Presley, Bruce Springsteen, and even The Rolling Stones. This purchase was all over the news, and to say that it did not sit well with McCartney would be a huge understatement. After all, someone that he considered a friend bought his music with the intention of profiting from it.</p><p>In his autobiography, Jackson would say, “Paul and I had both learned the hard way about business and the importance of publishing and royalties and the dignity of songwriting.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultimate Classic Rock</a>, &nbsp;McCartney would say, “I think it’s dodgy to do something like that. To be someone’s friend, and then buy the rug they’re standing on.”</p><p>The damaged bond&nbsp;between the two seemed irreparable, and McCartney had vowed to never work with Jackson again.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Fans Think Paul McCartney Is Cheap</a></span></p><h2 id=did-mccartney-ever-forgive-him>Did McCartney Ever Forgive Him?</h2><p>Over the years, McCartney and Jackson would never work together again, and during this time, Jackson was more than happy to license Beatles music while raking in tons of cash from it. It was a genius business move by Jackson, but his decision to buy the music ultimately cost him a friend.</p><p>After Jackson’s passing, rumors circulated that he was going to leave McCartney the music he lost out on in his will, but this proved to be false.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Ultimate Classic Rock,&nbsp;McCartney would talk about this, saying, “Some time ago, the media came up with the idea that Michael Jackson was going to leave his share in the Beatles' songs to me in his will. [It] was completely made up. The report is that I am devastated to find that he didn't leave the songs to me. This is completely untrue. I had not thought for one minute that the original report [about the will] was true, and therefore the report that I'm devastated is also totally false."</p><p>McCartney may have had his issues with Jackson, but after the&nbsp;singer’s passing, McCartney would offer some kind words, saying, “I feel privileged to have hung out and worked with Michael."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Paul McCartney’s Wife, Nancy Shevell?</a></span></p><p>According to&nbsp;BBC, McCartney would eventually reach a deal with ATV to get his hands on his music at long last.
