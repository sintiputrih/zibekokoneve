If you don’t have a food processor, place the graham crackers in a large Ziploc bag and crush with a rolling pin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step #2</strong>: Add 1 can of sweetened condensed milk and melted butter and mix until combined. Fold in chopped butterfinger bars, reserving some for the topping. Pour into a parchment paper lined pan.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step #3</strong>: Melt the milk chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second increments at 50% power until completely melted. You can use milk chocolate chips, milk chocolate bars, or milk chocolate melting wafers. Pour over the crust and spread evenly to the corners. Sprinkle chopped butterfinger candy bars on top of the chocolate.</p><p><strong>Step #4</strong>: Place the refrigerator or freezer to set the chocolate. Once the chocolate is set, cut them into squares.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Butterfinger-Bars-8-crop-720x536.jpg alt="These Crunchy Butterfinger Bars are made with graham crackers, sweetened condensed milk, melted butter, Butterfinger candy bars, and topped with milk chocolate.
