Mahl had apparently gotten into a fight with another lady as they argued over an ex-boyfriend. Brooks continued talking to her and realized that she went to the same university as him.

They tied the knot on <a href=#>May 24, 1986</a> in Oklahoma. Sadly, after 14 years with each other, the couple decided to call it quits in <a href=#>2000</a>.&nbsp;Brooks said that he would do his best to be a good father to their kids. He said, "I want to try and become for them what my Dad was and still is for me."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCl2ppamhfqbWmedSnq6iklGLBs8HToWSonl2crrPAx2aZq6efoMBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./galina-becker.html><span>←</span><span>Galina Becker - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Facts</span></a>
