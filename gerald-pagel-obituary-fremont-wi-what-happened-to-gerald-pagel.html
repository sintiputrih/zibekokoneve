He peacefully died on Saturday, April 29, 2017, at Agrace HospiceCare in Fitchburg. Teddy, born on May 3, 1931, in Franklin Township, Sauk County, Wisconsin, to Carl and Blanche (Hamberger) Pagel, was a highly valued individual who had a lasting impact on the lives of several people.</p><p><strong>An Affection for Existence</strong><br>Teddy’s life was characterized by a profound gratitude for the uncomplicated joys it presented. He derived pleasure from the aesthetics of nature and the exhilaration of engaging in hunting and fishing activities. Auctions were a favored leisure activity, providing him with an opportunity to uncover valuable items that were concealed in plain view. Teddy frequently indulged in gambling in the casino, exuding a mix of enthusiasm and inquisitiveness. His presence would elicit laughter and foster the exchange of anecdotes.</p><p><strong>An Expedition United</strong><br>Throughout his lifetime, Teddy discovered his true emotional connection with Joann M. Hall. Their marriage symbolized their deep affection and dedication, forming a connection that would endure the challenges brought by the passage of time and the unpredictable nature of life. Over time, Teddy and Joann’s affection and household expanded. Collectively, they commenced a voyage replete with mutual encounters, delights, and obstacles. They embraced the presence of children in their lives and wholeheartedly embraced the precious experiences of becoming parents.</p><p><strong>Nostalgic Recollections</strong><br>Teddy discovered a profound sense of purpose in his role as a parent, grandpa, and great-grandfather amidst life’s delights. He was a loving presence in the lives of his children, Patsy Rhinehart, Daniel G. (Pam) Pagel, Dan C. (Bonnie) Pagel, and Donald C. Pagel. The significant and insignificant moments that have been experienced have formed a collection of memories that will be deeply loved by his family.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpws8SrmKWcXaWuqLHLZqaboaSqrrPFjJ%2BpnqWfo8Fuw8hmrqGZpGK1orzPnqWenF2pvG6zxKuYpZxdpa6oscto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-godoy-html.html><span>←</span><span>David Godoy - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
