While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>HOT 97</a>, Charlotte Flair made it clear that she has her eyes on Rhea Ripley and Bianca Belair after WrestleMania 38.</p><p><strong>I guess it’</strong>s the question is, who’s there to beat me? Rhea and Bianca, are my targets next. I expect big things not that Bianca hasn’t already done big things, and I still look at my Money in the Bank match with Rhea Ripley, it was a great match. I want to see, you know, what’s next for the both of them and I’ve never had a completely full program with either one of them. I think Rhea has kind of been start-stop.</p><p>WrestleMania we had the NXT. But that wasn’t really followed up. You know, we had that WrestleMania match in the Performance Center during COVID and then I lost the title at TakeOver. So there was really no story or build-up or what happened after and then when we got when she came to Raw, it was the Money in the Bank match, but then it turned into a Triple Threat and I got cashed in on. So I still think there’s a story left there, and she’s got to climb this mountain, both of them.”</p><p>Charlotte Flair is set to defend her Smackdown Women’s Championship against Ronda Rousey at WrestleMania 38. We will have to wait and see how their feud will be booked in the meantime.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
