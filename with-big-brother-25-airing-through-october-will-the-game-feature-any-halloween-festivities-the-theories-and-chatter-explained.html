Recommended Videos With start date of Big Brother 25 being pushed to later in the summer due to the Writers Guild of America strike, we are only halfway through the season. Because of this, Big Brother 25 will be running throughout the Fall, something that has never been done before (at least on the original version of the hit competition show), ultimately allowing room for some never-been-seen-before twists and turns."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Any fun scary-verse shenanigans you’d pull if you were production? It’ll be final, what 6? So still plenty of people for them to have them all do something fun with the scary-verse stuff, and I’m wondering if scary-verse is only a thing because they knew they’d run ’til Halloween this year.”</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>In response to this intriguing question, Big Brother superfans across the globe responded with their theories.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=404 data-injectable=true>“I know production has been known to screw with them behind the mirrors in the house. Like dressed up as aliens and stuff. It’s been a few years though,” @slimbooter explained, bringing up an interesting aspect of the game that may have its resurgence around Halloween time.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>“Idk how many people have seen ‘Dead Set’ (a show about a zombie apocalypse on the set of BBUK), but I always thought it would be funny if they played a big joke on the houseguests and made them think the zombie apocalypse had started and they’d just been abandoned in the house,” @WoolyOcto suggested.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Big-Brother-Cameron-Hardin-Jared-Fields-Zombies.png><p data-characters=586 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>To top it all off, @IndyDude11 suggested a twist similar to what occurred with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cameron Hardin and Jared Fields and the Resurrection Rumble last week</a>: “You know what would be cool is if you had it planned to have a battle back of some sort, and then you take a couple of HGs that have been eliminated and dress them up as, say, zombies, and stick them back in the house around Halloween time. That’d be scary! Of course, you would prevent them from talking or interacting with the HGs without the other. Like locking them in a room or something. Zombies are dangerous!”</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>While these suggestions sound like loads of fun, contrary to popular belief, the Big Brother franchise has experimented with Halloween festivities in the past during Big Brother: Over the Top, a spin-off series that ran for one season from September to December of 2016.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=507 data-injectable=true>“BBOTT had Halloween and Thanksgiving in the house. For Halloween they gave them costumes, candy, etc. and had former houseguests showing up as trick or treaters on the feeds,” @spIllmatic1 explained — how fun is that?</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>“Imagine if they evict Cameron by that point and he comes back as a trick or treater 🤣🤣🤣🤣 The house would lose it,” @26007 joked, garnering 90 upvotes from Big Brother superfans across the worls</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>With spooky season officially underway and only a few weeks until Halloween, what tricks do Julie and the rest of the production team have up their sleeves for Big Brother 25?
