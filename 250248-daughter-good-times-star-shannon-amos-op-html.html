She <a class="me a" href=#>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>“He took our family to many places... so I guess that’s what inspired my wanderlust. I’m grateful to him for that.”</p><p class=dh>Shannon also told us that, growing up, John was just Dad in her eyes. Over the years, she realized the many lives he impacted by playing a strong Black man and father in “Good Times.”</p><p class=dh>She confessed that seeing <a class="me a" href=#>people of all nationalities</a> – including grown men – calling John their “TV dad” was “sweet,” as it says a lot about his work and how much he impacted the world.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>[Shannon’s] daughter, Quiera Noelle, also has a “case of wanderlust.”</strong></h3><p class=dh><strong class=bh>SHANNON’S SOUND HEALING RITUAL</strong></p><p class=dh>Nowadays, Shannon is not as involved in the entertainment industry as she once was. Still, she is creating content for her media company Black, Well and Good, combining her experience as a producer with her passion for wellness.</p><p class=dh>Speaking of wellness, John’s daughter attracted some attention in mid-November 2020 after uploading a video on Instagram showing her <a class="me a" href=#>daily sound healing ritual</a>.</p><p class=dh>In the clip, Shannon appears on her house’s rooftop, sitting on a mat with her legs crossed in front of a swimming pool while playing a soothing melody with her “<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/tv/CHlOIWJjAxF/>crystal singing bowls</a>.”</p><p class=dh>She wrote in the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/tv/CHlOIWJjAxF/>caption</a> that her sound healing ritual includes waking up at dawn and drinking some tea. Once on the rooftop, she can see the sun rising over the Caribbean ocean.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>SHANNON’S PERSPECTIVE ON LOVE</strong></p><p class=dh>In September, Shannon shared with her social media followers her <a class="me a" href=#>perspective about love</a> based on Bell Hooks' book “All About Love.” For her, love should be seen as an action rather than a feeling.</p><p class=dh>Apart from that, John’s daughter emphasized that love <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFXSKUOj73q/>should encompass</a> “trust, respect, integrity, compassion” and many other “ingredients” besides affection.</p><p class=dh>At the moment, Shannon is living in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. Her daughter, <a class="me a" href=#>Quiera Noelle</a>, who also has a “case of wanderlust,” has been traveling with her mom through Mexico.</p><p class=dh>Quiera even spent three years living in <a class="me a" href=#>South Korea and Thailand</a> and recently launched her company NomadiqNoelle.com, where she prepares millennials to teach, work, and live abroad.
