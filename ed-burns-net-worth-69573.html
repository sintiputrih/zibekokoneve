The second season focused on the death of white working class America through examination of the city ports. The third season "reflects on the nature of reform and reformers, and whether there is any possibility that political processes, long calcified, can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals." Burns has called education the theme of the fourth season. The writing drew extensively on his experience as a <a href=#>Teacher</a>. Rather than solely focusing on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. The fifth and final season focuses on the media's coverage of crime and corruption in Baltimore, tapping into Simon's past with <i>The Sun</i>. Burns was nominated for the <a href=#>Writers</a> Guild of America Award for Best Dramatic Series at the February 2009 ceremony for his work on the fifth season. Simon and Burns collaborated to write the series finale "-30-". The show was nominated for several Emmys and numerous other awards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeVmXqjwdGnqmamlal6uLvRrZ9mbmlqhHQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./d-j-shockley.html><span>←</span><span>D.
