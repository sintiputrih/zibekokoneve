Opening up on her failed marriage with Ghanaian actor, Chris Attoh, for the first time in an interview with media personality, Chude Jideonwo, Damilola Adegbite intimated that although her marriage crashed, she has learned her lesson but she does not regret the experience.
In her words;
“My marriage didn’t work but I learnt a massive lesson from that experience and it is that love is not enough…when you meet someone you want to send the rest of your life with, love is not enough…for me it is done, the only regard i have for him now is that he is the father of my son, I don’t regret anything."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
