"I saw how these Elmo guys were working in Times Square," he told <a href=#>The New York Times</a> in 2012. He bought a costume online and went to work. But unlike most of the others, Sandler's obnoxious behavior crossed the line and ended with police charging him with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest in September 2012. The officers arrested him after he went on an anti-Semitic tirade and refused to leave the area. A judge sentenced him to six hours of community service. He told the <a href=#>New York Post</a> he was himself Jewish and was mobbed by tourists who refused to tip him on the day of his arrest. He claimed they represented "Jewish business interests."</p><p>In September 2013, Sandler ended up with several felony charges for stalking an employee of the Girl Scouts in Manhattan where he had been a temporary employee before becoming "Evil Elmo." He also attempted to extort $2 million dollars from the organization, telling them that unless they paid him money, he would falsely claim the Girl Scouts arranged sexual encounters between men and its members. He served a year in jail on the charges.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kXBrbW5kZLCzu9KsZJynpaPBs8WMnKmipZViwLG%2BxJ5kqJ5dmsOquIyeo6anXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-refers-to-herself-as-a-witch-in-new-post.html><span>←</span><span>Taylor Swift Refers To Herself As A 'Witch' In New Post</span></a>
