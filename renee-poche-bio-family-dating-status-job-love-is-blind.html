Taking part in a heart-pounding journey of emotional growth and self-discovery was Renee Poche also. So, in this writing, we shall tell you who Renee is and what became of her potential emotional connection test.</p><h3><strong>Renee Poche On Love Is Blind Season 5</strong></h3><p>So, during the introduction, watchers were told that Renee Poche is a veterinarian in her early thirties. Viewers in a way were also made aware of her past loves, best attributes, deal-breakers, and just simple things one would like to know about someone on a first date.</p><p>Renee told the cameras that she feels like she has been single forever and has been extremely “focused” on her career in the five years since her last major relationship ended.</p><p>Now (in Love&nbsp;Is Blind) she said she is ready to step into a new chapter and straight into the arms of a “very manly” guy. She said she wants this man, better if with a beard, to get down with her homebody lifestyle and a menagerie of pets. And then her “live-in hubby” should be also okay with her tendency to be overly picky about starting a family. Also, she added he has to be okay with her not being able to keep track of their dates and her bad habit of forgetting people’s names.</p><h3><strong>What Is Renee Poche’s Dating Status?</strong></h3><p>Clearly, Paige Tillman was very much single when she decided to go on Love Is Blind. However, it is not understood if her relationship status changed while there.</p><h3><strong>Renee Poche Age</strong></h3><p>Renee Poche was reportedly born in 1991. Should this be true, she would have turned 31 years old in 2023.</p><h3><strong>Renee Poche Family</strong></h3><p>Renee’s mother is Dixie Huval Poche, AKA Dixie Lee Huval. On her <a href=#>Facebook</a>, Dixie mentioned working at Fugro&nbsp;and residing in Lafayette, Louisiana as of 2023. Also, in September of the year, she turned 68 years old.</p><p>Renee’s mom is actually a cookbook author. By June 2021, she had already written three books detailing stories and recipes behind Louisiana specialties. Her first book “Classic Eateries of Cajun Country” was inspired by Guidry’s Grocery and Meat Market, which is run by her aunt and uncle in Cecilia. In her second book, called “Louisiana Sweets”, she takes readers on a trip through the entire state, in search of the perfect sweet. Finally her third book, “The Cajun Pig”, traces the importance of the lowly porcine in Cajun cooking.</p><p>In addition to this, the graduate of ULL in journalism also has handled corporate communications for an engineering firm, plus did her work as a freelance travel writer. By mid-2021, she was awaiting the release of her fourth book about the Courir de Mardi Gras in Acadiana. On Dixie’s author BIO, it was also described that she does not cook, but does enjoy eating.</p><p>Then we have Rodney Joseph Poche, Renee’s dad. He turned 63 in April 2023. At this point, he was titled President at Gator Blood – Full Cajun Bloody Mary Mix. The former owner of&nbsp;Asset Realty also mentioned on FB about studying at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He cited Breaux Bridge, Louisiana as his current residence and also admitted to being “single”. So, at this point, Renee’s parents may be no longer together.</p><p>In her family, Renee also has a brother. His name is Roby Poche (on IG <a href=#>@robypoche</a>). He is a teaching assistant&nbsp;at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and also a capitol&nbsp;planner at the Washington State Department of Enterprise Services.</p><p>Other people known from this family are Renee’s late maternal grandmother Genevieve H. Huval and grandfather Michael Dale Huval. The paternal grandfather, Harry Joseph Poche is also no more. When he passed away at 89 in July 2022, he was married to Joyce L. Poche for over 42 years. Harry, a veteran, served his country in the United States Army during the Korean Conflict and was a member of the American Legion Post 133 and the VFW.</p><h3><strong>How Tall Is Renee Poche?</strong></h3><p>Renee Poche stands around 5’1″ or 1.55 meters in height.
