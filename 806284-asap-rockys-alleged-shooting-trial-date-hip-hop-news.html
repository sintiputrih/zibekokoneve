ASAP Rocky was not present in court when she made her decision. Kerlin's ruling comes after Judge ML Villar ruled that there is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sufficient evidence for the rapper to stand trial</a>, despite his attorneys pushing back.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-asap-rocky-s-trial-to-begin-on-october-21-2024>ASAP Rocky's Trial To Begin On October 21, 2024</h2></span><p>A$AP Rocky attends as Tiffany & Co. celebrates the debut of the Tiffany Titan by Pharrell Williams Collection at Tiffany & Co.

After the performer entered his not-guilty pleas earlier this year, his lawyer Joe Tacopina appeared confident in his ability to prove his client's innocence and indicated that they wouldn't be seeking a plea deal. "We’re going to try the case in the courtroom,” he told reporters at the time. “And when we do, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">facts will come out that show that he’s truly innocent</a>. And that he’s a victim in this case."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of ASAP Rocky's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">upcoming trial</a> getting an official start date at the end of October?
