He has since staged a number of competitions and charity drives that have seen hundreds of thousands of dollars pass hands.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=293 data-injectable=false>Despite several controversies over the years, MrBeast remains a steadfast presence among YouTube’s elite. His efforts rake in huge amounts of money, most of which is then typically rerouted to charities. Here’s what the popular YouTuber is worth after all his donations to charity.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>MrBeast’s net worth</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MrBeast_net_worth_image.jpg><p data-characters=609 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Through years of contributions to YouTube, MrBeast has accumulated a net worth of more than $25 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. The site notes that most of MrBeast’s accumulated wealth comes from ad revenue, sponsorships, and merchandise from his YouTube channel. Through ad revenue alone, the 23-year-old pulls in several million for a handful of videos and adds to this with several million more from sponsorships and merch sales. From merchandise sales alone, MrBeast pulls in around $174 thousand a day, according to Celebrity Net Worth, all of which adds to his other sources of income.</p><p data-characters=650 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true>The award-winning content creator generates a combined $3 million, approximately, on a monthly basis from his various YouTube channels. He’s pumped a good amount of this money into his charitable efforts, like Team Trees, but keeps hold of enough to pursue a number of business pursuits. Less than a quarter of a century into this life, he’s already launched a clothing line and even has a burger named after him. In 2021, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he was named</a> YouTube’s highest-paid star, edging out 10-year-old Ryan Kaji, who’d maintained his position at the top for several years. But does this impressive title make him the richest man on YouTube?</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Is MrBeast the richest YouTuber?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MrBeast_net_worth_charity.jpg><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=744 data-injectable=true>MrBeast is exceedingly wealthy for his age, but doesn’t quite rise to the rank of YouTube’s richest creator. That title goes to controversial makeup guru Jeffree Star, whose net worth vastly outpaces MrBeast’s. Star is worth a whopping $200 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, weighing in at around eight times MrBeast’s net worth and topping even his closest competitor — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Kaji</a> — by around $100 million.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=false>MrBeast’s charitable efforts are largely to blame for his lower-than-expected net worth. While he earns huge heaps of money on a yearly basis, he keeps only a small fraction of it. His net worth is only a quarter to that of Kaji, the very same creator he edged out in earnings in 2021. All that money isn’t going into Donaldson’s bank account, however, which leaves it at a much smaller — but still very impressive — number.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZqKrXaK%2Fo7HArKtmsZ%2BqwbauxKxkq6GTnbK0wIycqZ6ZpKS%2Fbq2Mpaaoo12WwW650ZucmqukqHqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lost-ark-how-to-farm-pirate-coins.html><span>←</span><span>Lost Ark: How to Farm Pirate Coins</span></a>
