In each act of True Tales Of The Violet Garden, there are multiple events in which players can take part. It includes The Moon and Stars Inscribe, Friendship In Writing Event as well as the A Story For You Quest. The last includes a quest for Yoimiya and Klee, and that is something fans are enjoying quite a lot. Likewise, the Friendship In Writing Event allows players to get a free Xiangqiu. This was quite a surprise for fans, and many were elated to receive a character for free.</p><h2 id=h-here-is-which-poem-stanza-to-choose-for-irodori-poetry-in-genshin-impact>Here Is Which Poem Stanza To Choose For Irodori Poetry In Genshin Impact</h2><p>When it comes to The Moon and Stars Inscribe event, it is a bit tricky and players are having a few issues in completing the quest. Unlike the other quest, it is not straightforward and requires players to do a number of tasks in order to complete the quest. To start off, players need to talk with Ootomo and Lenne to kick off the questline. After that, players will be required to take a snapshot of a variety of stuff, which includes Inazuma and Mondstadt specialties and animals.</p><p>The last task requires players to choose a poem stanza. A few players are a bit confused about this and are wondering which stanza of the poem they should choose for the quest. Well, the good news is that you can choose any stanza. Irrespective of which one you choose, the outcome of the quest remains the same and all of them will yield the same result. So simply choose any stanza you like, and you are good to go.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pcHApaqhp5OgsrO%2FjZympmeYmr%2BmecisZLCgmZi1brzOnqRmq6SWu7utjK2mZpuYpLy0sYyfpqtlmae8pbvRomSpp5Wpv7p5yKdkoJ2eqLWquoyipKmZk6l8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gwen-stefani-spring-2018-l-a-m-b-x-tura-glasses-interview.html><span>←</span><span>Gwen Stefani Spring 2018 L.A.M.B. x Tura Glasses Interview</span></a>
