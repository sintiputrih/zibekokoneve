Had he been able to make a choice again, he said he would have had his children with the same women. Despite this, Boosie is a committed father and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/4924039/boosie-badazz-children/>said </a>it was his job to "motivate" his children.</p><p class=dh>He encouraged them to chase their dreams but also stressed the importance of education. "School is very important to my household," Boosie <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/4924039/boosie-badazz-children/>said </a>and revealed that he grew up in a home where his mother taught him the importance of school.</p><p class=dh>The rapper <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/4924039/boosie-badazz-children/>said </a>he tried to motivate his kids and "keep (them) wanting more."
