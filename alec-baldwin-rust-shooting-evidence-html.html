Prosecutors filed <a href=#>documents</a> on June 17 that claim Baldwin was engaging in unsafe behavior with guns throughout his time on the set of Rust. <a href=#>Trial</a> is set to begin on June 10. The court documents submitted by prosecutor Erlinda Johnson introduce into evidence a photo of Baldwin in which Baldwin’s finger is “inside the trigger guard” and his thumb is on the gun’s hammer taken “minutes before” the 911 call about <a href=#>cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and director Joel Souza’s shooting</a>. There are also videos of Baldwin having his finger on the trigger of guns he was holding throughout the filming of Rust despite not needing to, of him using his gun to point at things, of him cocking and uncocking the gun unnecessarily, and of him “engaging in horseplay” with his gun. There are also multiple videos submitted of Baldwin having “control of the set” and stopping scenes from filming when he wanted or needed to.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxnive5200113b8026e43ewa@published data-word-count=83>Baldwin is standing trial for the second time for involuntary manslaughter in the 2021 shooting of Hutchins on the set of his film Rust. In 2023, Baldwin was relieved of all charges in the shooting, but retesting of his gun determined that the trigger did need to be pulled in order for the gun to be shot, and, in January 2024, Baldwin <a href=#>was indicted</a> by a grand jury. He is pleading not guilty, and, if convicted, faces up to 18 months in prison.</p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clx0yi4r800000ih8cmxegq9v@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Alec Baldwin Refuses to Give Up</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clvcxzc9u000k0ie95geral2x@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Alec Baldwin’s Lawyers Are Upset With the Rust Trial Prosecutors</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clv11zx6b001o0igijy7fj3r7@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Rust Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed Sentenced to 18 Months</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Prosecution Introduces Photos of Alec Baldwin on Rust Set</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyiuMScZJuZnJnEqrqMq6ysrF2otbC706KloGWVq7alsc2cnGegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./parker-amann-death-cause-and-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Parker Amann | Death Cause And Obituary</span></a>
