He has those weird Covid toes. If you've had Covid there's like burning in your feet.

Fevers and sweating. I think the worst part for me is like PTSD, from last year. It's exactly this time last year," she said.</p><p>It comes after Sursok's emotional video message last year, in which she wept openly as she revealed McEwen had been sick with a fever for days.</p><p>"There's so many people who are struggling and going through this, and you don't think it's going to be you or your family until it is. I've been so strong for the kids and for him for so many days," she said.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"I think we feel ashamed to feel pain and be scared, because we feel we always have to be strong all the time.

I know some people just feel like they have a cold or a flu, but a lot of people don't. My husband is really fit and healthy and … all the hospitals are full. Be safe, please, wear a mask. I'm begging you … just do it for someone else."</p><p>Sursok, who grew up in Sydney, started her career playing Dani Sutherland on Home And Away for four years from 2000. She scored several Australian hit singles during a short-lived music career after leaving the soap, before moving to the US in 2006 to focus on her acting career.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>More work followed, with recurring roles in The Young And The Restless, Hannah Montana and Pretty Little Liars.</p><p>Sursok and McEwen held a beachside vow renewal on the Gold Coast in December, in which the actress reflected on her husband's near-fatal battle with Covid.</p><p>"I surprised my entire family with a 10-year vow renewal. To dear Sean, on our 10-year wedding anniversary," Tammin captioned the post.</p><p>"We almost lost you a year ago. I remember driving down the street and my heart started breaking.</p><p>"Us together, walking through life, though better or worse, in sickness and in health. Today I vow to create more memories with you."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwsMLInWRqcV2dvK6xjJqlnWWRrK66ecCcq6udo6h6ta3MpqCnZaOqv7S7ymapnq6Vlrm0eceuqpuZnpnAbr%2FTq5inn5VisLDCyJ1krLGdpcGwudJoi4uRYo6XhKOte3xubnR%2FmYSlqG5pkHx8i5pw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cesar-augusto-gonzalez-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-706009-html.html><span>←</span><span>Cesar Augusto Gonzalez Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biogr</span></a>
