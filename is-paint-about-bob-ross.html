Keep reading for everything you need to know about Paint, Owen Wilson's character, and more.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: IFC Films</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is 'Paint' about Bob Ross? Owen Wilson plays an artist named Carl Nargle.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, the plot of Paint, which is an independent comedy film, "follows Carl Nargle, who has hosted Vermont’s #1 painting show for the past 27 years with his signature whisper keeping viewers from Pittsfield to St. Albans breathlessly hanging on his every stroke until the station hires a younger, better painter who steals everything and everyone Carl loves."</p><p>The film's concept was developed by writer-director Brit McAdams and was initially on the Black List for 2010. <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">The Black List</a> is an annual survey in Hollywood of the most-liked but unproduced screenplays. Although it took more than a decade, Brit McAdams finally found a cast and crew for Paint.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Although Paint would appear to be about Bob Ross — down to his signature hairstyle and soothing voice — the film is firmly about an entirely fictional character called Carl Nargle. The main conflict of Paint is Carl's identity crisis when a younger artist steals the spotlight from him. This is a notable difference from Bob Ross's career, where his show The Joy of Painting ran unimpeded on PBS from 1983 to 1994.</p><p>So, for those who enjoy Bob Ross but wonder what would happen if he had been replaced by a rising star in Hollywood, Paint could be the film for you. The flick, which also stars Michaela Watkins, Wendi McLendon-Covey, and Ciara Renée, will release in theaters on April 7, 2023. Currently, there is no word yet if Paint will be available on streaming services.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvMCipa1lkZe8tsCMm6abZaKkwLQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./india-eisley.html><span>←</span><span>India Eisley; Age, Parents, Net Worth</span></a>
