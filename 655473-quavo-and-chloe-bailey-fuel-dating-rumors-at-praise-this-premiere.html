<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Quavo And Chloe Bailey Fuel Dating Rumors At &amp;quot;Praise This&amp;quot; Premiere</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hotnewhiphop.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-14795858011.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>With the <a href=# rel>release of Peacock's original film Praise This</a> just days away, the cast was treated to a red-carpet premiere. This included the film's stars, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Chloe Bailey</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Quavo</a>. Praise This follows Bailey as Sam, a wannabe superstar who joins an Atlanta-based competitive gospel choir ahead of a national competition. Praise This is the latest from Tina Gordon, the director behind films such as Peoples and Little. Gordon also wrote a similar film about an underdog team in a national competition, 2002's Drumline. Praise This will release exclusively on Peacock on April 7.</p><p>At the premiere, Bailey posed with Quavo, who plays a character called Ty. Quavo's appearance in the film reflects a shift towards acting for the former <a href=# class=text-word rel>Migos</a> member. Last year, Quavo appeared in the thriller Strange Salvation and has been linked to upcoming projects Takeover and Cash Out. Prior to his role in Strange Salvation, Quavo's only film and TV credits were cameos in shows such as Atlanta. It is the latest role in a run of major projects for Bailey. She is also set to appear in the horror film The Georgetown Project, and star as the lead in the biopic Midas Touch.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-quavo-x-chloe-on-the-red-carpet>Quavo x Chloe On The Red Carpet</h2></span><p>Their work on Praise This, amongst other appearances, has led to numerous rumors that the pair are currently dating. While <a href=# rel>Bailey has denied these rumors</a>, many fans remain unconvinced. This has led to further claims of a secret romance. These rumors are likely to be fanned further still if their characters in Praise This share some sort of romantic subplot. Trailers for the film seem to indicate that this is the case.</p><p>Dating rumors aside, Praise This will serve as a chance for both Bailey and Quavo to flex their acting muscles. It will also enable them to perform in more comedic roles. This is a contrast to the much more serious roles they have previously performed. Furthermore, with the likes of Bailey and Quavo involved, it seems to be a sure bet that if nothing else, Praise This is going to have some exceptional vocal performances.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-more-photos>More Photos</h2></span><p>Chloe Bailey, Tina Gordon and Quavo attend the "Praise This" World Premiere at Rialto Center for the Arts at Georgia State University on April 3, 2023 in Atlanta, Georgia.
