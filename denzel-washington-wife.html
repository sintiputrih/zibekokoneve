Despite this, he still views his role as husband to his better half, wife Pauletta Washington, as the most significant one he’s ever taken on.</p><p>In 2010, he stated to The Guardian, “There is no secret to the ideal marriage.” “Everybody has highs and lows; we have as well. You know, it’s laborious. But we agreed to something. Marriage, employment, and mental stability all benefit from a strong spiritual foundation.”</p><h3>Who is Denzel Washington married to?</h3><p>On September 28, 1950, Pauletta Pearson was born in Newton, North Carolina, where she was raised alongside Rita Pearson, another actress. Her mother was a teacher, while her father ran the school. Pauletta entered the Miss North Carolina pageant for the first time as a Black woman in 1970, placing as the second runner-up.</p><p>Pauletta is a pianist with classical training who also sings; by the age of 10, she was already participating in piano competitions. Later, she attended the North Carolina School of the Arts, The Juilliard School in New York, and North Texas University for graduate work as a result of her piano studies. She accepted a position in musical theater at the theme park Six Flags Over Texas, and while she enjoyed it, she finally relocated to New York on the advise of the musical director there. She performed there until 1977, when she started dabbling with movies.</p><p>She is a member of the Spelman Board of Trustees and The Brain Trust of Cedars-Sinai, an organization that generates money and awareness for brain care and research. She and Denzel have both been active members of the organization for more than 20 years. The Pauletta and Denzel Washington Gifted Scholars Program, a <a href=#>community</a> outreach initiative started by their family, gives science-inclined college, graduate, and medical students the chance to participate in cutting-edge Cedars-Sinai neurosciences research projects.</p><h3>How did Denzel Washington meet his wife, Pauletta?</h3><p>After collaborating on the 1975 television film Wilma, in which Denzel played Olympian Wilma Rudolph’s husband and Pauletta played a fellow track star, Denzel and Pauletta started dating in the late 1970s.</p><p>In 1996, Pauletta also described how she and Oprah met by stating that their common friend—who was also in the movie—had hosted a party. At the very end of the celebration, Denzel and his buddies arrived. We continued our conversation. We were introduced again. Then, something genuinely amazing took place. The following evening, I went to a performance. I arrived late, sneaked in, and immediately sat down. When the lights came up and we were seated close to each other at intermission, I didn’t pay attention to who was sitting around me.”</p><p>On Jimmy Kimmel Live, Denzel once admitted that Pauletta had to cover the cost of the cab journey on their first date because he ran out of money.</p><h3>Is Pauletta Washington still an actress?</h3><p>Yes! In the television show Genius: Aretha, Pauletta most recently played Rachel Franklin, Aretha Franklin’s grandmother. She appeared in the 2021 movie Steps, which Shaquille O’Neal executive produced, as well as the <a href=#>Netflix</a> series She’s Gotta Have It.</p><p>She will co-star in a new project with Jennifer Hudson, it was revealed in the summer of 2021. They will both be included in Taraji P. Henson’s seven-segment movie Tell it Like a Woman.</p><h3>Does Pauletta Washington sing?</h3><p>Washington stated that she regarded herself to be more of a musician than an actress during a 2011 appearance on The Wendy Williams Show. She clarified that it was because she could sing and play the piano. She also gave an explanation of why she wanted a break from work so she could raise her kids. Washington reflected on her past by saying, “When I got pregnant, I felt I had such a solid childhood with my mom, coming home and seeing my mom.” She said that while she was in New York performing on Broadway, Denzel was in Los Angeles filming the television series St. Elsewhere during the time of her pregnancy. Where would the youngster be, she wondered after taking the distance into account. She stated that she had made the decision to “remain at home and make a home” “and declared her satisfaction with her choice.</p><h3>How many kids do Denzel and Pauletta Washington they have?</h3><p>There are four kids for the couple. John David Washington, the first child born to Denzel and Pauletta in 1984, has recently established himself as an A-list actor in his own right by appearing in the films <a href=#>Tenet</a> and BlacKkKlansman.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/pauletta-washington-john-david-washington-denzel-washington.jpg alt="denzel washington children,pauletta washington,denzel washington wife age,denzel washington wife and kids,denzel washington wife birthday,denzel washington family,denzel washington age,denzel washington wife young,denzel washington wife net worth,denzel washington wife 2021,denzel washington wife quote,denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife&amp;#039;s name,denzel washington wife height,denzel washington wife and son,how old is denzel washington wife,how tall is denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife,what do denzel washington wife do,what happened to denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife in the equalizer,what does denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife look like,is denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife an actress,wedding denzel washington wife,who played denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife in american gangster,denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife pauletta" width=490 height=361 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>They had a daughter named Katia three years after John David was born, and then in 1991 they had twins named Olivia and Malcolm.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/denzel-washington-kids-denzel-washington-children-malcolm-washington-katia-washington-pauletta-washington.jpg alt="denzel washington children,pauletta washington,denzel washington wife age,denzel washington wife and kids,denzel washington wife birthday,denzel washington family,denzel washington age,denzel washington wife young,denzel washington wife net worth,denzel washington wife 2021,denzel washington wife quote,denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife&amp;#039;s name,denzel washington wife height,denzel washington wife and son,how old is denzel washington wife,how tall is denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife,what do denzel washington wife do,what happened to denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife in the equalizer,what does denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife look like,is denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife an actress,wedding denzel washington wife,who played denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife in american gangster,denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife pauletta" width=490 height=438 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After graduating from Yale University with a law degree in 2010, Katia worked on a number of movies, including Fences, Assassination Nation, Pieces of a Woman, and her brother John David’s Malcolm & Marie.</p><p>The Last Bookstore, Trouble Man and Benny Got Shot, North Hollywood, The Dispute, and Summer of 17 are just a few of the movies that Malcolm has produced or directed after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 2013.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gettyimages-167885131.jpg alt="denzel washington children,pauletta washington,denzel washington wife age,denzel washington wife and kids,denzel washington wife birthday,denzel washington family,denzel washington age,denzel washington wife young,denzel washington wife net worth,denzel washington wife 2021,denzel washington wife quote,denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife&amp;#039;s name,denzel washington wife height,denzel washington wife and son,how old is denzel washington wife,how tall is denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife,what do denzel washington wife do,what happened to denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife in the equalizer,what does denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife look like,is denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife an actress,wedding denzel washington wife,who played denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife in american gangster,denzel washington&amp;#039;s wife pauletta" width=490 height=736 sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Olivia holds a degree in acting and modeling from New York University.

Desmond Tutu, a well-known activist and archbishop, presided over the service.</p><p>Denzel never ceases to honor the woman in his life. In 2019, when he was given the Lifetime Achievement Award by the American Film Institute, he thought back on their connection “four decades of giving. Forgiveness spanning forty years. She taught me about love, true love, steadfast love, and loving despite myself. There is a significant distinction between a house and a home. While a man may certainly turn a house into a home, my wife has done the heavy lifting by raising our children, providing for them, and protecting them. You can buy a house, but it doesn’t make it a home.”</p><p>He continued, “Without Pauletta Washington, I wouldn’t be here.” “I wouldn’t make it,”</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="denzel washington children,pauletta washington,denzel washington wife age,denzel washington wife and kids,denzel washington wife birthday,denzel washington family,denzel washington age,denzel washington wife young,denzel washington wife net worth,denzel washington wife 2021,denzel washington wife quote,denzel washington's wife's name,denzel washington wife height,denzel washington wife and son,how old is denzel washington wife,how tall is denzel washington's wife,what do denzel washington wife do,what happened to denzel washington's wife in the equalizer,what does denzel washington's wife look like,is denzel washington's wife an actress,wedding denzel washington wife,who played denzel washington's wife in american gangster,denzel washington's wife pauletta" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
