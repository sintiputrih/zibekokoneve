Post-match, SKY was joined by Bayley to celebrate. In the midst of their celebration, Dakota Kai made a surprise appearance at Ford Field to reunite with her fellow Damage CTRL members. The journey to get there produced some complications though.</p><p>During her latest <a href=#>Twitch stream</a>, Kai revealed she had a rather short window of time to travel from Florida to SummerSlam in Detroit, Michigan. Thinking she wouldn’t be needed on the show, Kai noted that she had set her phone on “do not disturb” while she slept in that day. When she finally woke up though, Kai discovered that her phone was full of missed calls and texts.</p><p>“I literally found out that they wanted me to be there [at] 1 p.m. on that day,” Kai said. “I was still chilling, I was like, ‘Oh, it’s Saturday. It’s my sleep-in day.’ I’m going to chill, not even going to set my alarm. My phone was on ‘do not disturb.’ I always have my phone on ‘do not disturb when I’m not needed. And I was like, ‘Cool, I’m just going to sleep in.'”</p><p>“I wake up. My phone is blowing up. I was like, ‘Oh my God,’ and my anxiety was just through the roof. I just saw all these missed calls, all these texts, and Bayley is trying to call me. She’s like, ‘We need you here.’ And I’m like, ‘Do you guys know what day it is and what time it is and where I am and where SummerSlam is?’ The math ain’t mathing right now.”</p><h2 id=h-on-a-time-crunch>On A Time Crunch</h2><p>Kai said that WWE initially wanted her to board on a 5:15 pm flight out of Florida. Due to the time crunch, though, Kai felt she couldn’t make it, so she opted to take a slightly later flight on Spirit Airlines instead — an airline that Kai had never taken before. Unfortunately, that flight experienced some maintenance issues, which delayed Kai’s departure to roughly 7:15 pm EST.</p><p>Upon landing, Kai was frantic. At this point, WWE SummerSlam was about halfway over, as Shayna Baszler and Ronda Rousey had just completed their match. Luckily for Kai, WWE’s car service was equipped with a makeup artist who was already set up inside the car.</p><p>“We landed and thank goodness they sent like car service to come and get me,” Kai said. “They also had like a makeup lady in the car. We were like literally at that point. I run to baggage claim, car service is there to come get me. We rushed to the car, the SUV, and the lady that does my makeup’s already set up in the car and it’s about 20 minutes’ drive from the airport to the venue. So, I’m getting my makeup done. We’re, zooming through the streets. The lady doing my makeup, we’re playing like freakin’ Tetris with the makeup brush on my face. Lucky [IYO SKY’s] match was semi-main, because I definitely wouldn’t have made it [in time], I don’t think.”</p><p><a href=#>Dakota Kai Says She’s ‘A Ways Away’ From Being In-Ring Cleared</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJyanJwYWKxorfOrZhmo5Geeq2t0q1kpqGeqsGmec2oq6KblWLEuLGMrKympZWnwK2tzA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amber-mezner.html><span>←</span><span>Amber Mezner- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity</span></a>
