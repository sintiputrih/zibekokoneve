The Atmospherians is a satire about two best friends who start a cult to reform problematic men, and over the course of writing it, I fell headfirst into everything I could find about cults: who forms them, who joins them, and who leaves them.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckox03spx00193h6gp2q86nah@published data-word-count=212>The popularity of cult and scam narratives has, predictably, coincided with one of the great scams of recent memory, when a shady real-estate tycoon grifted his way into the American presidency. As we continue to reckon with the damages caused over the last four years — which also served to highlight the structural harms perpetrated in this country long before 2016 — it makes sense that Americans would begin to obsess over mythmakers and grifters and cult leaders: those who promise us better futures while keeping all the gains to themselves.&nbsp;Americans are driven by equal parts admiration for hard work and easy answers. We believe in the long slog of determination and grit, but we also want everything immediately and conveniently. Cults capture what is most vulnerable about the American psyche: We work arduous hours without vacations or adequate health care and are left eager for someone to tell us what is true, whether it’s a boss or influencer or news anchor or political grifter or cult leader. We long for truth but don’t have the time to figure it out. Cult narratives capture both the allure and danger of living this way. They show us, from a safe distance, how easy it is to become what we most fear becoming: fools.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckox09xvv003i3h6gvvnyqldk@published data-word-count=50>Below is a list of some of the most provocative and engaging books, movies, TV shows, and podcasts about cults that aided in my research, as well as a few titles that I’ve discovered since completing my book.

He remained a member for 22 years, serving as the group’s primary filmmaker and propagandist. This documentary offers a tender portrait of the young people who fell under the spell of Buddhafield’s leader Michel Rostand, a middling actor and former ballet dancer. While this story might feel familiar on its surface — a charismatic manipulator takes advantage of people desperate for love and community — this documentary differs from others like it thanks to the insider footage it includes, and Allen’s personal reckoning with Rostand’s abuse.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckox0cugx004a3h6gwbfcnf2j@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Enlighten Us: The Rise and Fall of James Arthur Ray (2017)" href=#>Enlighten Us: The Rise and Fall of James Arthur Ray (2017)</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckox03uok001f3h6gnry3ikhx@published data-word-count=105>James Arthur Ray was a prominent self-help figure in the early 2000s. He appeared on Oprah and in the movie The Secret and was admired by his followers for his intense commitment to the Law of Attraction — manifesting what you want into your life. In 2009, however, at a “Spiritual Warrior” retreat spearheaded by Ray, three attendees died while participating in a sweat-lodge exercise. Eighteen others were hospitalized and Ray was convicted of negligent homicide. This documentary follows Ray’s rise and fall, his pseudoscience and abuse, and it offers a glimpse into his ill-fated attempt to regain his career after being released from prison.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckox0fl78004r3h6gvf4zentv@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Deprogrammed (2015)" href=#>Deprogrammed (2015)</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckox03uvs001h3h6g7fby5h43@published data-word-count=95>A cult documentary that focuses on the other side of the cult: What happens when someone decides to leave. This movie follows the life and career of Ted “Black Lightning” Patrick, an anti-cult crusader who started a movement in the early ’70s to help young people escape abusive cults with the aid of concerned parents and law enforcement. Patrick’s methods were controversial, and not everyone he works with benefits from his deprogramming techniques. But this documentary sheds light on the long, hard journey people face as they learn to think for themselves after being brainwashed.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckox0j4me00583h6g1mullul6@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief&nbsp;(2015)" href=#>Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief&nbsp;(2015)</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckox03uz9001j3h6glylmpusi@published data-word-count=91>A must-watch for anyone interested in the machinery of Scientology. This <a href=#>2015 documentary</a> is a modern classic, based on Lawrence Wright’s book of the same name. It offers a detailed history of Scientology’s founder, L. Ron Hubbard, and explores how the group holds power over its members. In gripping and intimate interviews, former members recount their abuse and exploitation during their time as part of the Church of Scientology. It also provides a rare window into the hierarchy system that serves as an integral part of keeping members invested in Scientology.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckox0kdon005p3h6ggevieoja@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="The Source Family (2013)" href=#>The Source Family (2013)</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckox03vrl001l3h6g63kvl78p@published data-word-count=96>The Source Family is a cult documentary that feels relatively quiet compared to some of the others on this list. There is no question that the group’s leader, former actor and bodybuilder Father Yod, financially and emotionally exploited members of his California-based cult, the Source Family. And the documentary tackles the emotional consequences of that abuse on many of its members long after the cult dissolved. However, former members who speak in the documentary seem, at times, almost fond of their time in the Source Family, and those memories are what make this film stand out.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckox0m61f00653h6gznreotc5@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Nonfiction Books</span></h2><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=8BlQU3 data-merchant-id=156572 data-track-name="The Road to Jonestown: Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple by Jeff Guinn" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Simon & Schuster" data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fe8/720/bcbac5580e57804f6ebb10ac0c9053606f-the-road-to-jonestown.rdeep-vertical.w245.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=8BlQU3 data-merchant-id=156572 data-track-name="The Road to Jonestown: Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple by Jeff Guinn" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Simon & Schuster" data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>The Road to Jonestown: Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple by Jeff Guinn</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> $19<span> now 21% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckox1hhvy007h3h6gcn9cwaob@published data-word-count=99>I read this book knowing very little about Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple beyond the tragedy that occurred in Jonestown and gave us the phrase, “Drinking the Kool-Aid.” This biography of Jones shows how someone who appears to be driven by a commitment to progressive and radical ideas can unwittingly evolve into a selfish and manipulative force. While this is not a sympathetic portrait of Jones, it is a surprisingly nuanced look at the man that captures not only his unconscionable abuse but what seemed, at the time, like an authentic desire to do good in the world.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=8BlQU3 data-merchant-id=156572 data-track-name="The Road to Jonestown: Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple by Jeff Guinn" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=8BlQU3 data-merchant-id=156572 data-track-name="The Road to Jonestown: Jim Jones and the Peoples Temple by Jeff Guinn" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=15 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$15</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=AxJb8t data-merchant-id=156573 data-track-name="Bunk: The Rise of Hoaxes, Humbug, Plagiarists, Phonies, Post-Facts, and Fake News by Kevin Young" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Graywolf Press" data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/689/22f/bdc73c55558b8b7f5692eab5bec69171ac-bunk-.rdeep-vertical.w245.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=AxJb8t data-merchant-id=156573 data-track-name="Bunk: The Rise of Hoaxes, Humbug, Plagiarists, Phonies, Post-Facts, and Fake News by Kevin Young" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer="Graywolf Press" data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Bunk: The Rise of Hoaxes, Humbug, Plagiarists, Phonies, Post-Facts, and Fake News by Kevin Young</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$17</span> $18<span> now 6% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$17</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckox1kn4i008d3h6gcz31kyf8@published data-word-count=99>In Bunk, critic, poet, and New Yorker poetry editor Kevin Young argues that the hoax is a uniquely American phenomenon. This expansive historical book is less about individual cults than it is the mind-set and culture that set the foundation for so many of the cults that appear on this list. Young’s critical eye draws connections between the snake-oil salesmen and P.T. Barnums of adolescent America and contemporary impostors like James Frey and Rachel Dolezal. This comprehensive book is necessary reading for anyone interested in how cult leaders and hucksters construct the elaborate backstories that draw in their members.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=AxJb8t data-merchant-id=156573 data-track-name="Bunk: The Rise of Hoaxes, Humbug, Plagiarists, Phonies, Post-Facts, and Fake News by Kevin Young" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$17</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=AxJb8t data-merchant-id=156573 data-track-name="Bunk: The Rise of Hoaxes, Humbug, Plagiarists, Phonies, Post-Facts, and Fake News by Kevin Young" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=17 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$17</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=XpOZNC data-merchant-id=156571 data-track-name="Cults in our Midst by Janja Lalich and Margaret Singer" data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=Jossey-Bass data-track-price=22 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/502/4cc/0e2768921903d1ec1e04e691f2823a5f73-cult-.rdeep-vertical.w245.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=XpOZNC data-merchant-id=156571 data-track-name="Cults in our Midst by Janja Lalich and Margaret Singer" data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=Jossey-Bass data-track-price=22 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Cults in our Midst by Janja Lalich and Margaret Singer</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$22</span> $29<span> now 24% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$22</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckox1eeh6006y3h6gqx814pnj@published data-word-count=80>This book differs greatly from many of the other texts on this list.

Though it would be a stretch to claim that the tech start-ups that appear in Wiener’s memoir are cults, the <a href=#>group rituals and collective thinking</a> practiced by many of these companies, ostensibly in the service of an idyllic future, sound eerily similar to the missions of many of the cults included on this list.

This documentary took over every conversation when it premiered on Netflix in 2018. The six-part series details the life of Indian guru&nbsp;Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his followers, the Rajneeshees, who took over the small town of Antelope, Oregon, to create their intentional community, Rajneeshpuram. This expertly crafted series does an excellent job conveying the seductiveness of Rajneesh. The most compelling parts are the interviews with Rajneesh’s former assistant, Ma Anand Sheela, who shows little remorse over her actions and remains bitter over the dissolution of Rajneeshpuram.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckox1vqz700au3h6gf2zff7ac@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult" href=#>Seduced: Inside the NXIVM Cult</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckox03wvf00213h6g5vis3qlm@published data-word-count=99>Of <a href=#>last year’s two documentaries</a> about the disturbing NXIVM cult led by Keith Raniere, this is, for me, the more successful.

Seduced focuses primarily on the story of former member India Oxenberg, daughter of the actress Catherine Oxenberg, as she reckons with what she suffered during her time in NXIVM and tries to move on with her life.

But the story of the Family deserves a closer look. Hamilton-Byrne led a small group of middle-class Australians, a large chunk of whom were nurses and doctors, in regular hatha yoga classes. However, in 1968, Hamilton-Byrne acquired a property she named Kai Lama and proceeded to acquire 14 children — either taken from group members or illegally adopted with the aid of her followers. Hamilton-Byrne homeschooled and brainwashed the children until, in 1987, Kai Lama was raided by police and all the children were removed from the compound.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/ckox25e8p00c93h6gt2waoiv0@published><a data-vars-anchor-text="Helter Skelter: An American Myth" href=#>Helter Skelter: An American Myth</a></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckox03xda00273h6gih02b0kb@published data-word-count=88>This recent miniseries, which premiered in 2020 on Epix, crosses over the well-trod terrain of Charles Manson and the Family.

This seemingly clear-cut case becomes far more complicated when Rogers claims Mineo begged to be killed after Shriner kicked him out of her online cult.

Past and current followers of Teal’s appear on the series and provide conflicting narratives about the role she played in the deaths of her followers.

They also do a great job showing the cultlike tendencies of groups we might not readily think of as cults.

This novel captures the seductive appeal of losing yourself as you’re drawn into the larger and dangerous world of adulthood.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=emknvi data-merchant-id=156580 data-track-name="The Girls by Emma Cline" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=10 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$10</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=emknvi data-merchant-id=156580 data-track-name="The Girls by Emma Cline" data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=10 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$10</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - image" data-track-id=r4RIp6 data-merchant-id=156583 data-track-name=Severance data-track-option=Image data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=Picador data-track-price=11 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fb4/10d/a23f1b44af3b95e99e806e0426ce1df6a6-severance.rdeep-vertical.w245.jpg></a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - name" data-track-id=r4RIp6 data-merchant-id=156583 data-track-name=Severance data-track-option=name data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer=Picador data-track-price=11 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span>Severance</span></a> <span class=product-buy-price>$11</span> $18<span> now 39% off</span> <span class=product-buy-price>$11</span> Photo: Publisher<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckox3q5kk00k93h6gy3hma4pn@published data-word-count=78><a href=#>Ling Ma’s Severance</a> is one of those novels that fits into just about every category: It’s an office novel, a capitalist satire, a tender story of a mother-daughter relationship, a zombie thriller, and, finally, a cult novel. The final section of this book, which takes place in an abandoned shopping mall where a group of survivalists have started a cult, offers a smart and funny critique of how people might react in the face of capitalism’s horror-fueled collapse.</p><a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class=product-buy-link data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - button" data-track-id=r4RIp6 data-merchant-id=156583 data-track-name=Severance data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=11 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$11</span> at Amazon Buy</a> <a href=# rel=sponsored,nofollow class="product-buy-link narrativ-link" data-track-type=product-link data-track-variant="product - narrativ button" data-track-id=r4RIp6 data-merchant-id=156583 data-track-name=Severance data-track-option=Button data-track-merchant=Amazon data-track-manufacturer data-track-price=11 data-track-currency=$ data-track-badges data-track-source data-track-medium data-track-campaign data-affiliate-links-ignore=true><span class=product-buy-price>$11</span> at Amazon Buy</a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckk4hzlrn00009en5krv297mn@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>What American Horror Story: Cult Got Right—and Very Wrong—About the Trump Era</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckgtu2pi20000uqnch6y56iuo@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Which NXIVM Docuseries Is Right for You?</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ck5e0p95a00e6n0y6gg5qi8e2@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Is the Wellness Industry a Scam?
