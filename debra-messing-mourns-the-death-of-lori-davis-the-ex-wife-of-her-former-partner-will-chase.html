It was special because it was entirely chosen.</p><p><strong>Debra</strong> opened up about reconnecting with <strong>Lori</strong> recently.</p><p>“We connected recently. She wrote a personal recommendation for my boy’s application to her college alma mater. I wrote letters for both of the girls’ as well. We rooted for each other. We sent singing happy birthday videos to each other, and she helped me celebrate my 50th birthday. We were chosen family,” she said. “Many many hearts are shattered right now. Please say a prayer for her family. And remember, we are guaranteed nothing. ?.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tonJWXv6J5zJ6qrKGenHquu9SrpaxlpJ2ybrDEmquhZZ%2Bbeq270aJknZmmnsBuwMeeZJ6wXay2p7GMqJ1moJWneqe70aacq2Wglr%2B1usSrZLChnKF6pLTArJxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./all-forms-of-trunks-in-the-dragon-ball-franchise.html><span>←</span><span>All forms of Trunks in the Dragon Ball franchise</span></a>
