Recommended Videos In the season three premiere, we caught up with most of the big characters in the show – Ted, Coach Beard, Roy, Keeley, Nate, Rebecca, Rupert, and the AFC Richmond squad, but one notable absence in the season so far has been Trent Crimm, formerly of The Independent."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Out of respect for Ted, Trent notifies him when he is about to publish a scathing article about his panic attacks, and leaks his source.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>Of course, this leads to Trent being fired from The Independent, only to be replaced in the AFC Richmond press room by Marcus Adebayo at the publication.

Lance has had many roles in both live action and voiceover, winning the Best Voice Actor award at the 2022 Overcome Film Festival in The Mountain short.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>We’re hoping to see James Lance reprise his role as Trent Crimm and find out what he’s been up to since The Independent fired him, but we’ll have to wait and see if he pops up a little later in Ted Lasso season three.
