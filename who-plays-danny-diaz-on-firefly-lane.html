Although the first batch of episodes ends on a pretty depressing note, one of the highlights of this season is watching Tully reconnect with her former flame, Danny Diaz. Played by Ignacio Serricchio, Danny is shown to be hard-working, honest, and fun, qualities that Tully’s previous love interests have severely lacked.</p><p dir=ltr>As reported by Decider, Serricchio is a multilingual Argentinian actor who started his career with a one-off role in the medical drama “House.” According to IMDb, the actor continued to have guest appearances on shows like “Ghost Whisperer,” “Covert Affairs,” “Bones,” and “Good Girls.” However, soap opera fans might recognize Serricchio from his longer stints on “General Hospital” and “The Young and the Restless.” The same source shows that Serricchio has also dedicated time to show off his vocal talents on popular animated shows like “American Dad!,” “Robot Chicken,” “Tuca & Birdie,” and “Family Guy.”</p><p dir=ltr>With such a diverse filmography, it’s clear that Serricchio can give a nuanced performance like Danny. Whether or not Danny and Tully end up together for good, it will be interesting to see how this new character shapes the narrative. Fans will have to wait and see if Danny is here to stay when the final six episodes of Season 2 premieres on June 8, 2023 (via Netflix).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cMPHqGSppJGuwG6wwKelsmWUnq67ec6nZJ%2BhopqzrcWMpZinnV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./michelle-wolf-is-defending-her-sarah-huckabee-sanders-jokes-html.html><span>←</span><span>Michelle Wolf Is Already Defending Her Sarah Huckabee Sanders Jokes</span></a>
